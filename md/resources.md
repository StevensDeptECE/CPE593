## LEARNING ACCOMODATIONS

It is the policy of this instructor to require all students entitled
to learning accommodations to take a first test in regular time.
Students are expected to use this to learn how the tests are
conducted, to identify their weaknesses in knowledge are so they can
improve their performance.  Note that these assessments are designed
with far more than enough time.  The difficulty is when students do
not really know the material, which is why this course allows
restesting.

Students entitled to extra time may have that time when retesting if
they need it.

Note that this policy is in accordance with the law. You are entitled
to extra time, but even if it is stressful, I am entitled to ask you
to take the first test in regular time provided I give you the
opportunity to retest with have extra time.

If you have any questions about the
legality, please contact Phillip Gehman, the Director of Disability
Services Coordinator at Stevens Institute of Technology at
pgehman@stevens.edu or by phone (201) 216-3748.

## INCLUSIVITY 
### Name and Pronoun Usage 
As this course includes group work and in-class discussion, it is vitally important for us to create an educational environment of inclusion and mutual respect. This includes the ability for all students to have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name affirmed. If the class roster does not align with your name and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor of the necessary changes.

### Inclusion Statement

In this class, the perspective of people of all races, ethnicities, gender expressions and gender identities, religions, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities will be respected and viewed as a resource and benefit throughout the semester. Suggestions to further diversify class materials and assignments are encouraged. If any course meetings conflict with your religious events, please do not hesitate to reach out to your instructor to make alternative arrangements.

You are expected to treat your instructor and all other participants in the course with courtesy and respect. Disrespectful conduct and harassing statements will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary actions.

## MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES
 Part of being successful in the classroom involves a focus on your whole self, including your mental health.  While you are at Stevens, there are many resources to promote and support mental health.  The Office of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) offers free and confidential services to all enrolled students who are struggling to cope with personal issues (e.g., difficulty adjusting to college or trouble managing stress) or psychological difficulties (e.g., anxiety and depression).  Appointments are strongly encouraged and can be made by phone (201-216-5177) or in-person (on the 7th floor of the Howe Center). CAPS is open from 9:00 am – 5:00 pm Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and from 9:00 am – 7:00 pm on Tuesdays during the Fall and Spring semesters.
