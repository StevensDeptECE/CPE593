chapter i
it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters
my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that
netherfield park is let at last
mr bennet replied that he had not
but it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and she
told me all about it
mr bennet made no answer
do not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently
you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it
this was invitation enough
why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is
to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week
what is his name
bingley
is he married or single
oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four
or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls
how so how can it affect them
my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them
is that his design in settling here
design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he
may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes
i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send
them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are
as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the
party
my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but
i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now when a woman has
five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty
in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of
but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood
it is more than i engage for i assure you
but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go
merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new
comers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit
him if you do not
you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very
glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy
i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the
others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so
good humoured as lydia but you are always giving her the
preference
they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters
mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take
delight in vexing me you have no compassion on my poor nerves
you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they
are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least
ah you do not know what i suffer
but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood
it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them
depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them
all
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour
reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character her mind
was less difficult to develope she was a woman of mean understanding
little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented she
fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her
daughters married its solace was visiting and news
chapter ii
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he
had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following
manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he
suddenly addressed her with
i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy
we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother
resentfully since we are not to visit
but you forget mama said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the
assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him
i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces
of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion
of her
no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you
mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain
herself began scolding one of her daughters
don't keep coughing so kitty for heaven's sake have a little
compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces
kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times
them ill
i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully
when is your next ball to be lizzy
to-morrow fortnight
aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back
till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him
for she will not know him herself
then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce
mr bingley to her
impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him
myself how can you be so teazing
i honour your circumspection a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after
all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as
she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will
take it on myself
the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsense
nonsense
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he do
you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on
them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you
mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great
books and make extracts
mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how
while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr
bingley
i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife
i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before if i
had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on
him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we
cannot escape the acquaintance now
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy
was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while
how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should
persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a
good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said
a word about it till now
now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr bennet and
as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife
what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was
shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness
or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so
pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but
for your sakes we would do any thing lydia my love though you are
the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next
ball
oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the
youngest i'm the tallest
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return mr bennet's visit and determining when they should ask him to
dinner
chapter iii
not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five
daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley they attacked him
in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and
distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour
lady lucas her report was highly favourable sir william had been
delighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely
agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party nothing could be more delightful to be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively
hopes of mr bingley's heart were entertained
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield
said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well
married i shall have nothing to wish for
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet's visit and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library he had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard
much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more
fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had
mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all mr bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation c mrs bennet was quite
disconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another and never
settled at netherfield as he ought to be lady lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a
large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought
only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin and when
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and
another young man
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman-like he had a pleasant
countenance and easy unaffected manners his sisters were fine women
with an air of decided fashion his brother-in-law mr hurst merely
looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance of his having ten thousand a year the gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be
proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his
large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance
was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one
himself at netherfield such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves what a contrast between him and his friend mr darcy danced
only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being
introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party
his character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable man in
the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit
down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his
friend to join it
come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better
dance
i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am
particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it
would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with
i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a
kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty
you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr
darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet
oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i
dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you
which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at
elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said
she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles for you are wasting your time with me
mr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him she told the story
however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively
playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrs
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield
party mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been
distinguished by his sisters jane was as much gratified by this as her
mother could be though in a quieter way elizabeth felt jane's
pleasure mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in good
spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they
were the principal inhabitants they found mr bennet still up with a
book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that all his wife's
views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear
oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most
delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there
jane was so admired nothing could be like it every body said how well
she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with
her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her
twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody
can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
down the dance so he enquired who she was and got introduced and
asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss
king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane
again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger 
if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently
he would not have danced half so much for god's sake say no more of
his partners oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance
oh my dear continued mrs bennet i am quite delighted with him he
is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women i never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses i dare say the
lace upon mrs hurst's gown 
here she was interrupted again mr bennet protested against any
description of finery she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at
all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very
great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my
dear to have given him one of your set downs i quite detest the man
chapter iv
when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in
her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him
he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good
humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease
with such perfect good breeding
he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought
likewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby complete
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i
did not expect such a compliment
did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between
us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what
could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is
very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a
stupider person
dear lizzy
oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general
you never see a fault in any body all the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life
i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak
what i think
i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder with your
good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others affectation of candour is common enough one meets it every
where but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good
of every body's character and make it still better and say nothing of
the bad belongs to you alone and so you like this man's sisters too
do you their manners are not equal to his
certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her
elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very
little disposed to approve them they were in fact very fine ladies not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited they were
rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the
habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people
of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves and meanly of others they were of a respectable family in
the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate
but did not live to do it mr bingley intended it likewise and
sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to
purchase
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but
though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs hurst who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her mr bingley had not been of
age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
look at netherfield house he did look at it and into it for half an
hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a
great opposition of character bingley was endeared to darcy by the
easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the
firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion in
understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no means deficient
but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty reserved and
fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting in
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him
there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or
pleasure miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too
much
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired
her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom
they should not object to know more of miss bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose
chapter v
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets
were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade
in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and
quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by
business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world for
though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the
contrary he was all attention to every body by nature inoffensive
friendly and obliging his presentation at st james's had made him
courteous
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to mrs bennet they had several children the
eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty-seven
was elizabeth's intimate friend
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate
you began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civil
self-command to miss lucas you were mr bingley's first choice
yes but he seemed to like his second better
oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be
sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he
did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something
about mr robinson
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not
i mention it to you mr robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his
answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet
beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point
upon my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as
if but however it may all come to nothing you know
my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said
charlotte mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend
is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable
i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips
are you quite sure ma'am is not there a little mistake said
jane i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her
aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he
could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to
miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance with them he is remarkably
agreeable
i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was
every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had
heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise
i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas but i
wish he had danced with eliza
another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him
if i were you
i believe ma'am i may safely promise you never to dance with him
his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride
often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour
should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right
to be proud
that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive
his pride if he had not mortified mine
pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have
ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human
nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different
things though the words are often used synonimously a person may be
proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us
if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with his
sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of
foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs
bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle
directly
the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she
would and the argument ended only with the visit
chapter vi
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visit
was returned in due form miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a
wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the
two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them
though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration it was
generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to
her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a
way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane
united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent she mentioned this to her friend miss
lucas
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose
on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all
begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more
affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he
may never do more than like her if she does not help him on
but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can
perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too
remember eliza that he does not know jane's disposition as you do
but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal
it he must find it out
perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane
meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chuses
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined
to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but
these are not jane's feelings she is not acting by design as yet she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four
dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house
and has since dined in company with him four times this is not quite
enough to make her understand his character
not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four
evenings may do a great deal
yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like vingt-un better than commerce but with respect to any other
leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded
well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if
she were married to him to-morrow i should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar before-hand it does not advance their felicity in the
least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life
you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not
sound and that you would never act in this way yourself
occupied in observing mr bingley's attentions to her sister elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend mr darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness of
this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with
he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing
with her himself attended to her conversation with others his doing so
drew her notice it was at sir william lucas's where a large party were
assembled
what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my
conversation with colonel forster
that is a question which mr darcy only can answer
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see
what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by
being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him
on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she
turned to him and said
did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well
just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at
meryton
with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic
you are severe on us
it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas i am going
to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows
you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me
to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken
a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers on miss lucas's persevering however
she added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancing
at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of
course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge' and i
shall keep mine to swell my song
her performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a song
or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always
impatient for display
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her
application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with
much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the
end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with
some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
at one end of the room
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas
was his neighbour till sir william thus began
what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy there
is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies
certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can
dance
sir william only smiled your friend performs delightfully he
continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy
you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir
yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do
you often dance at st james's
never sir
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place
it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it
you have a house in town i conclude
mr darcy bowed
i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of
superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
london would agree with lady lucas
he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to
make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to
her
my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing mr darcy you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you
cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you
and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though
extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly
drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william
indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion
you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us
for one half hour
mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling
he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we
cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a
partner
elizabeth looked archly and turned away her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some
complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley
i can guess the subject of your reverie
i should imagine not
you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion
i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people what would
i give to hear your strictures on them
your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more
agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity
miss elizabeth bennet
miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley i am all astonishment
how long has she been such a favourite and pray when am i to wish you
joy
that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a lady's
imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love
to matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me joy
nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled you will have a charming mother-in-law indeed and
of course she will be always at pemberley with you
he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe her wit flowed long
chapter vii
mr bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in
default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mother's
fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply
the deficiency of his her father had been an attorney in meryton and
had left her four thousand pounds
she had a sister married to a mr philips who had been a clerk to their
father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in
london in a respectable line of trade
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most
convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way the two youngest of the family
catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions
their minds were more vacant than their sisters' and when nothing
better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news
the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the
head quarters
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers' names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret
and at length they began to know the officers themselves mr philips
visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers and mr
bingley's large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their
mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr
bennet coolly observed
from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but
i am now convinced
catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect
indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the
next morning to london
i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly
of any body's children it should not be of my own however
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it
yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever
this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish
my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i
liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart
and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should
want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel
forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his
regimentals
mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first
came she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited
for an answer mrs bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was
eagerly calling out while her daughter read
well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well
jane make haste and tell us make haste my love
it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud
 my dear friend
 if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and
 me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
 lives for a whole day's tte tte between two women can never
 end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on the receipt of
 this my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers
 yours ever
 caroline bingley
with the officers cried lydia i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
that
dining out said mrs bennet that is very unlucky
can i have the carriage said jane
no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to
rain and then you must stay all night
that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home
oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingley's chaise to go to meryton
and the hursts have no horses to theirs
i had much rather go in the coach
but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are
wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they
they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them
but if you have got them to-day said elizabeth my mother's purpose
will be answered
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was
delighted the rain continued the whole evening without intermission
jane certainly could not come back
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more than
once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the next
morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield
brought the following note for elizabeth
 my dearest lizzy
 i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be
 imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will
 not hear of my returning home till i am better they insist also on
 my seeing mr jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
 of his having been to me and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
 there is not much the matter with me
 yours c
well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note
aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she
should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
mr bingley and under your orders
oh i am not at all afraid of her dying people do not die of little
trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays
there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the
carriage
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though
the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horse-woman walking
was her only alternative she declared her resolution
how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a
thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get
there
i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want
is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the
horses
no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing
when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner
i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required
we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and
lydia elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set
off together
if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may
see something of captain carter before he goes
in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing
field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within
view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise
she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour where all but jane were
assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise that she should have walked three miles so early in the day
in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs
hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it she was received however very politely by them
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
politeness there was good humour and kindness mr darcy said very
little and mr hurst nothing at all the former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone the
latter was thinking only of his breakfast
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered miss
bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well
enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit was delighted at her entrance she was not equal
however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with elizabeth silently attended
her
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth
began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they shewed for jane the apothecary came and having
examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a
violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it
advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts the advice
was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head
ached acutely elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were
the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere
when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very
unwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern
in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the
present elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was
dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring
back a supply of clothes
chapter viii
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six
elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil enquiries which then
poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of mr bingley's she could not make a very
favourable answer jane was by no means better the sisters on hearing
this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how
shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored
elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency his anxiety for jane was evident and his
attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others she had very little notice from any but him miss bingley was
engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr
hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to
eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish
to a ragout had nothing to say to her
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence
she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty mrs hurst
thought the same and added
she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent
walker i shall never forget her appearance this morning she really
looked almost wild
she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very
nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the
country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsy
yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep
in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office
your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was
all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably
well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice
you observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such
an exhibition
certainly not
to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is
above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by
it it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence
a most country town indifference to decorum
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said
bingley
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper
that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes
not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise a
short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again
i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet
girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such
a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no
chance of it
i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
meryton
yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside
that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it
would not make them one jot less agreeable
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world replied darcy
to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations
with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till
late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself on entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the
excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book mr hurst looked at her with astonishment
do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular
miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards she is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else
i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am
not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things
in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and
i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well
elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying he immediately offered to fetch her
others all that his library afforded
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more
than i ever look into
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left
so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at
pemberley mr darcy
it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many
generations
and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying
books
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these
neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be
half as delightful as pemberley
i wish it may
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a
finer county in england than derbyshire
with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it
i am talking of possibilities charles
upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little
attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near
the card-table and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest
sister to observe the game
is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley will
she be as tall as i am
i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height or
rather taller
how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me
so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely
accomplished for her age her performance on the piano-forte is
exquisite
it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are
all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean
yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover skreens and net
purses i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being
informed that she was very accomplished
your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has
too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen but i am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my
acquaintance that are really accomplished
nor i i am sure said miss bingley
then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman
yes i do comprehend a great deal in it
oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing
dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all
this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word
will be but half deserved
all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women
i rather wonder now at your knowing any
are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this
i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and
application and elegance as you describe united
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all
conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room
eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it
succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art
undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed
there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and
that she could not leave her bingley urged mr jones's being sent for
immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could
be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal and it was settled
that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet
were not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters
declared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchedness
however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister
chapter ix
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a
note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her
own judgment of her situation the note was immediately dispatched and
its contents as quickly complied with mrs bennet accompanied by her
two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast
had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been
very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield she
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think
it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss
bingley's appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour bingley met them with hopes
that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected
indeed i have sir was her answer she is a great deal too ill to be
moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass
a little longer on your kindness
removed cried bingley it must not be thought of my sister i am
sure will not hear of her removal
you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility
that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us
mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not
know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a
vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is
always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest
temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to
her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is
equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i
hope though you have but a short lease
whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i
should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five
minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth
you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her
oh yes i understand you perfectly
i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen
through i am afraid is pitiful
that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours
lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home
i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a
studier of character it must be an amusing study
yes but intricate characters are the most amusing they have at
least that advantage
the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society
but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever
yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of that
going on in the country as in town
every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment
turned silently away mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him continued her triumph
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for
my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal
pleasanter is not it mr bingley
when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and
when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their
advantages and i can be equally happy in either
aye that is because you have the right disposition but that
gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing
at all
indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her
mother you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which
you must acknowledge to be true
certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with four and twenty families
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
countenance his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards
mr darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts now asked her if
charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away
yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir
william is mr bingley is not he so much the man of fashion so
genteel and so easy he has always something to say to every
body that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy
themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the
matter
did charlotte dine with you
no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies for
my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own
work my daughters are brought up differently but every body is to
judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i
assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think
charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend
she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley
oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself
has often said so and envied me jane's beauty i do not like to boast
of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body
better looking it is what every body says i do not trust my own
partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my
brother gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away
but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he
wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has
been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love
i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy
of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is
strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again she longed to
speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to
jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy mr bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be
civil also and say what the occasion required she performed her part
indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward the two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the
youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at netherfield
lydia was a stout well-grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age she had high
animal spirits and a sort of natural self-consequence which the
attentions of the officers to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was very
equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and
abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it his answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear
i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when
your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill
lydia declared herself satisfied oh yes it would be much better to
wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter
would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball she
added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not
mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned
instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of
all miss bingley's witticisms on fine eyes
chapter x
the day passed much as the day before had done mrs hurst and miss
bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who
continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room the loo table however did not appear
mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching
the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and
mrs hurst was observing their game
elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between darcy and his companion the perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing or on the evenness
of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each
how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter
he made no answer
you write uncommonly fast
you are mistaken i write rather slowly
how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year letters of business too how odious i should think them
it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours
pray tell your sister that i long to see her
i have already told her so once by your desire
i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend
pens remarkably well
thank you but i always mend my own
how can you contrive to write so even
he was silent
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss
grantley's
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at
present i have not room to do them justice
oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you
always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy
they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me
to determine
it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with
ease cannot write ill
that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her
brother because he does not write with ease he studies too much for
words of four syllables do not you darcy
my style of writing is very different from yours
oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents
your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof
nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of
humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an
indirect boast
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty
the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in
writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think
at least highly interesting the power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else
nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i
believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this
moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies
i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as
dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were
mounting your horse a friend were to say 'bingley you had better stay
till next week' you would probably do it you would probably not
go and at another word might stay a month
you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much
more than he did himself
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a
circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i
could
would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it
upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for
himself
you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but
which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand
according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the
delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one
argument in favour of its propriety
to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit
with you
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either
you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire without waiting to be argued into it
will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties
by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not
forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more
weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure
you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with
myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not
know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in
particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening
when he has nothing to do
mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense
i see your design bingley said his friend you dislike an
argument and want to silence this
perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss
bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very
thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me
what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr
darcy had much better finish his letter
mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she
seated herself
mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcy's eyes were fixed
on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her was still more strange she could only imagine however
at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than
in any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked
him too little to care for his approbation
after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a
lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near
elizabeth said to her 
do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel
she smiled but made no answer he repeated the question with some
surprise at her silence
oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately
determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say 'yes'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell
you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if
you dare
indeed i do not dare
elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his
gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her he really
believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he
should be in some danger
miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of
their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance
i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day you will give your mother-in-law a few hints when this
desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue
and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to
check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence
which your lady possesses
have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity
oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be
placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your great uncle
the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different
lines as for your elizabeth's picture you must not attempt to have it
taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes
it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their
colour and shape and the eye-lashes so remarkably fine might be
copied
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and
elizabeth herself
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some
confusion lest they had been overheard
you used us abominably ill answered mrs hurst in running away
without telling us that you were coming out
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk
by herself the path just admitted three mr darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said 
this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the
avenue
but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them
laughingly answered
no no stay where you are you are charmingly group'd and appear to
uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth good bye
she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening
chapter xi
when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister
and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the
drawing-room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared
their powers of conversation were considerable they could describe an
entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressed
himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst
also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness
and warmth remained for bingley's salutation he was full of joy and
attention the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she
should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place that she might be farther from the
door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else
elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great
delight
when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table but in vain she had obtained private intelligence that mr
darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected she assured him that no one intended to play and the
silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her mr
hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same
and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss
bennet
miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr
darcy's progress through his book as in reading her own and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page she
could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her
question and read on at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not
an excellent library
no one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly
towards him and said
by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at
netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult
the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure
if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses
before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and
as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my
cards
i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were
carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day
much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be
near so much like a ball
miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at
whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious in the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to
elizabeth said
miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a
turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude
elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately miss bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked
up he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book he was
directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
down the room together with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere what could he mean she was dying to know what could
be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him
not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe
on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
about it
miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any
thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon
as she allowed him to speak you either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be
completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better
as i sit by the fire
oh shocking cried miss bingley i never heard any thing so
abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech
nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth we
can all plague and punish one another teaze him laugh at
him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done
but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me that teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind no
no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose
ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr
darcy may hug himself
mr darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth that is an
uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would
be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a
laugh
miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be the
wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke
certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am
not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies
and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i
laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what
you are without
perhaps that is not possible for any one but it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule
such as vanity and pride
yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real
superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile
your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss
bingley and pray what is the result
i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it
himself without disguise
no said darcy i have made no such pretension i have faults enough
but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch
for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the
convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper
would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost
for ever
that is a failing indeed cried elizabeth implacable resentment
is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i
really cannot laugh at it you are safe from me
there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome
and your defect is a propensity to hate every body
and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand
them
do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a
conversation in which she had no share louisa you will not mind my
waking mr hurst
her sister made not the smallest objection and the piano-forte was
opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for
it he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention
chapter xii
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day but mrs bennet who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which
would exactly finish jane's week could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before her answer therefore was not propitious at
least not to elizabeth's wishes for she was impatient to get home mrs
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very
well against staying longer however elizabeth was positively
resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the
contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long
she urged jane to borrow mr bingley's carriage immediately and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
that morning should be mentioned and the request made
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
jane and till the morrow their going was deferred miss bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at
netherfield long enough she attracted him more than he liked and miss
bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most
conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost
all took place miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most
tenderly she even shook hands with the former elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother mrs bennet
wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again but their
father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really
glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle the
evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its
animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and
elizabeth
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to catherine and lydia had
information for them of a different sort much had been done and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of
the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been
flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going
to be married
chapter xiii
i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at
breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner to-day
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party
who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners
are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger mrs
bennet's eyes sparkled a gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley
i am sure why jane you never dropt a word of this you sly thing
well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley but good
lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day lydia
my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this moment
it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i
never saw in the whole course of my life
this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained
about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i
answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring
early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases
oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned
pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing
in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs
bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and
nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn
but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself
no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false
friends why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father
did before him
why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head as you will hear
 hunsford near westerham kent
 15th october
 dear sir
 the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
 father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the
 misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the
 breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing
 lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
 terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at
 variance there mrs bennet my mind however is now made up on
 the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been
 so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right
 honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh
 whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
 rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
 demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be
 ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
 instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i
 feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
 all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds
 i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
 commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the
 entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side
 and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch i cannot be
 otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
 amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to
 assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but
 of this hereafter if you should have no objection to receive me
 into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
 you and your family monday november 18th by four o'clock and
 shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday
 se'night following which i can do without any inconvenience as
 lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
 sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
 duty of the day i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to
 your lady and daughters your well-wisher and friend
 william collins
at four o'clock therefore we may expect this peace-making gentleman
said mr bennet as he folded up the letter he seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again
there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he
is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to
discourage him
though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his
credit
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady
catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required
he must be an oddity i think said she i cannot make him
out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he
would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir
no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter which promises well i am impatient to see him
in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem
defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i
think it is well expressed
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting it was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as for
their mother mr collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters
mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great
politeness by the whole family mr bennet indeed said little but the
ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall
heavy looking young man of five and twenty his air was grave and
stately and his manners were very formal he had not been long seated
before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this
instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but
mrs bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily
you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may
prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so
oddly
you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate
ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you
must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things
i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed
i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and
could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come
prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps
when we are better acquainted 
he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each
other they were not the only objects of mr collins's admiration the
hall the dining-room and all its furniture were examined and praised
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet's
heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its
cookery was owing but here he was set right by mrs bennet who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen he begged
pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour
chapter xiv
during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants
were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady
catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes and consideration for his
comfort appeared very remarkable mr bennet could not have chosen
better mr collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself
experienced from lady catherine she had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings
and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two to visit his relations she had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs
that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet and i
dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her does she live near you sir
the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from rosings park her ladyship's residence
i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family
she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very
extensive property
ah cried mrs bennet shaking her head then she is better off than
many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome
she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am
informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still
resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies
has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at
court
her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town
and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived
the british court of its brightest ornament her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most
elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by
her these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay
you judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment or are the result of previous study
they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible
mr bennet's expectations were fully answered his cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance
and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in
his pleasure
by tea-time however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was glad to
take his guest into the drawing-room again and when tea was over glad
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies mr collins readily assented
and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging
pardon protested that he never read novels kitty stared at him and
lydia exclaimed other books were produced and after some deliberation
he chose fordyce's sermons lydia gaped as he opened the volume and
before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she
interrupted him with
do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard
and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so
herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr
collins much offended laid aside his book and said
i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes
me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon mr bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements mrs
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's
interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would
resume his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront seated himself at another table with mr bennet and prepared
for backgammon
chapter xv
mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he
had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful
acquaintance the subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head living in
retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he
felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness
mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a
clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness self-importance and humility
having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to
marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had
a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report
this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's
estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and
suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part
his plan did not vary on seeing them miss bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled
choice the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter
of an hour's tte tte with mrs bennet before breakfast a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at
longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on as to
her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could
not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her
eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her
to hint was likely to be very soon engaged
mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon
done done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire elizabeth equally
next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course
mrs bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before was now high in her good graces
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister
except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them
at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him
and have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followed
him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr
bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford such
doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly in his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told
elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore
was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their
walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and
go
in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his
cousins their time passed till they entered meryton the attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin
in a shop window could recal them
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom
they had never seen before of most gentleman-like appearance walking
with an officer on the other side of the way the officer was the very
mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire
and he bowed as they passed all were struck with the stranger's air
all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if
possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot mr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to
introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day
before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming his appearance was
greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine
countenance a good figure and very pleasing address the introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably
when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were
seen riding down the street on distinguishing the ladies of the group
the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual
civilities bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the
principal object he was then he said on his way to longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her mr darcy corroborated it with a bow and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting both changed colour
one looked white the other red mr wickham after a few moments
touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return
what could be the meaning of it it was impossible to imagine it was
impossible not to long to know
in another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed what
passed took leave and rode on with his friend
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
mr philips's house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydia's
pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs
philips' throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
invitation
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from
their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own
carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if
she had not happened to see mr jones's shop boy in the street who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield
because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed
towards mr collins by jane's introduction of him she received him with
her very best politeness which he returned with as much more
apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with
her which he could not help flattering himself however might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had
brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the shire she had been watching him the last hour
she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham
appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid
disagreeable fellows some of them were to dine with the philipses the
next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr
wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn
would come in the evening this was agreed to and mrs philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards the prospect of such
delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits mr
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless
as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or
both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs
philips's manners and politeness he protested that except lady
catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although
utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be attributed
to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life
chapter xvi
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt and all mr collins's scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing-room
that mr wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation and was then in
the house
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings
was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the
description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-rooms and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all
the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the
improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs philips a very attentive
listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could to the girls who could not listen to their cousin
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece the
interval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last however the
gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room
elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking
of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration the
officers of the shire were in general a very creditable
gentleman-like set and the best of them were of the present party but
mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and
walk as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips
breathing port wine who followed them into the room
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the
probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest
dullest most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the
officers mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the
young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a
kind listener in mrs philips and was by her watchfulness most
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her
in return by sitting down to whist
i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad
to improve myself for in my situation of life  mrs philips was
very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason
mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia at first there
seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely for she was a most
determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets
she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in
particular allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to
hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy she dared not
even mention that gentleman her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved mr wickham began the subject himself he inquired how far
netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in
an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject
drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i
understand
yes replied wickham his estate there is a noble one a clear ten
thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy
elizabeth could not but look surprised
you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after
seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy
as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent
four days in the same house with him and i think him very
disagreeable
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being
agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to
be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else here you are in your own family
upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the
neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked in
hertfordshire every body is disgusted with his pride you will not find
him more favourably spoken of by any one
i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short
interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen the
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his
high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen
i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an
ill-tempered man wickham only shook his head
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer
i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i
was at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood
oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he
wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms
and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for
avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of
very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is
his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men
that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be
in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been
scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every
thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with
all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the
neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added
which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a
most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me
farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them
society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and
my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have
now made it eligible the church ought to have been my profession i
was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now
indeed
yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me
i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply
and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given
elsewhere
good heavens cried elizabeth but how could that be how could
his will be disregarded why did not you seek legal redress
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the
intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i
was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no
less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too
freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very
different sort of men and that he hates me
this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced
some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me till i
can forget his father i can never defy or expose him
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them
but what said she after a pause can have been his motive what
can have induced him to behave so cruelly
a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me
less his son might have borne with me better but his father's uncommon
attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of
preference which was often given me
i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked
him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as
this
after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember
his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his
resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must
be dreadful
i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can
hardly be just to him
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to
treat in such a manner the god-son the friend the favourite of his
father she could have added a young man too like you whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented
herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from
childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest
manner
we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest
part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house
sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care my
father began life in the profession which your uncle mr philips
appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use
to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the
pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most
intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance
and when immediately before my father's death mr darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself
how strange cried elizabeth how abominable i wonder that the very
pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better
motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for
dishonesty i must call it
it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend it has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none
of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride
can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good
yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his
money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve
the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what
his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to
degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the
pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride
which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful
guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers
what sort of a girl is miss darcy
he shook his head i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain
to speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brother very
very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and
extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her
amusement but she is nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about
fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her
father's death her home has been london where a lady lives with her
and superintends her education
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first and saying
i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley
who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable
be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you
know mr bingley
not at all
he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr
darcy is
probably not but mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not
want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride
never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal-minded just
sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing
something for fortune and figure
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round
the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin
elizabeth and mrs philips the usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter it had not been very great he had lost every point
but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance
that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not
make herself uneasy
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a
card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady
catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters
mr wickham's attention was caught and after observing mr collins for
a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh
lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a
living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her
notice but he certainly has not known her long
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy
were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy
no indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's
connections i never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday
her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss
bingley vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already
self-destined to another
mr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her
daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship
i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his
patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman
i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have
not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked
her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from
her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr
wickham's attentions there could be no conversation in the noise of
mrs philips's supper party but his manners recommended him to every
body whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done
gracefully elizabeth went away with her head full of him she could
think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all
the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and
mrs philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at longbourn house
chapter xvii
elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr
wickham and herself jane listened with astonishment and concern she
knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr
bingley's regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham the
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to
interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be
done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and
throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained
they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or
other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them
without actual blame on either side
very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody
laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places mr darcy to be treating his father's favourite in such a
manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is
impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his
character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him oh no
i can much more easily believe mr bingley's being imposed on than
that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony if it
be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his
looks
it is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to
think
i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think
but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr
bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the
affair became public
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was
fixed for the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation to the rest of the family they paid little attention
avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth
and nothing at all to the others they were soon gone again rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet's civilities
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a
ceremonious card jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and
elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr
wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcy's
looks and behaviour the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia
depended less on any single event or any particular person for though
they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr
wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and
a ball was at any rate a ball and even mary could assure her family
that she had no disinclination for it
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough i
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements
society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
body
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept mr bingley's invitation and if he
did whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to
dance
i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of
this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can
have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting
yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a
preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right
cause and not to any disrespect for her
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in she had fully proposed being
engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins
instead her liveliness had been never worse timed there was no help
for it however mr wickham's happiness and her own was per force
delayed a little longer and mr collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with his
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more it now first
struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to her elizabeth however did not chuse to
take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer and
till he did it was useless to quarrel about him
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the
younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time
for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once no
aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoe-roses
for netherfield were got by proxy even elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than
a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and
monday endurable to kitty and lydia
chapter xviii
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in
vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her the certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than
usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening but in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcy's
pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers and though this
was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend mr denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and
who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant
smile
i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here
this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by
elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for
wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to
wickham she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and
turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality
provoked her
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her
spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had
not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular
notice the two first dances however brought a return of distress
they were dances of mortification mr collins awkward and solemn
apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being
aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give the moment of her release from
him was ecstacy
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of
wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked when those dances
were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with
her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without
knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again
immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind charlotte tried to console her
i dare say you will find him very agreeable
heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me
such an evil
when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her
hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence elizabeth made no
answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it
they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at
first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made
some slight observation on the dance he replied and was again silent
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with
it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about
the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
the room or the number of couples
he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said
very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones but now we may be silent
do you talk by rule then while you are dancing
sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of
some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible
are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine
both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial
taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure
said he how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly
i must not decide on my own performance
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to meryton she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist
the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just
been forming a new acquaintance
the effect was immediate a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself
for her own weakness could not go on at length darcy spoke and in a
constrained manner said
mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them
is less certain
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth
with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life
darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject at
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very
superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the
first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not
disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated
especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing
at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will
then flow in i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you
sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir
william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and
jane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortly
he turned to his partner and said
sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of
i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without
success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine
what think you of books said he smiling
books oh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same
feelings
i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be
no want of subject we may compare our different opinions
no i cannot talk of books in a ball-room my head is always full of
something else
the present always occupies you in such scenes does it said he
with a look of doubt
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy
that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was
unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being
created
i am said he with a firm voice
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice
i hope not
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion
to be secure of judging properly at first
may i ask to what these questions tend
merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring
to shake off her gravity i am trying to make it out
and what is your success
she shook her head i do not get on at all i hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly
i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary
greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either
but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another
opportunity
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for
in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her
which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against
another
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her
so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george
wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a
thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you
among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the
late mr darcy's steward let me recommend you however as a friend
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr
darcy's using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he
has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has
treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the
particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to
blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is a
most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it
i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite's guilt
but really considering his descent one could not expect much better
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said
elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of mr darcy's steward and of that i can
assure you he informed me himself
i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer
excuse my interference it was kindly meant
insolent girl said elizabeth to herself you are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr
darcy she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
evening elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment
solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing
else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness
i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case
you may be sure of my pardon
no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing
satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his
history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct
the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that
mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has
received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
sister's mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am
afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcy's
regard
mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself
no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton
this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am
perfectly satisfied but what does he say of the living
he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard
them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to
him conditionally only
i have not a doubt of mr bingley's sincerity said elizabeth warmly
but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr
bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as i did before
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of
bingley's regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew
to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
make a most important discovery
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness i happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother
lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would
have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de
bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology
you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy
indeed i am i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier
i believe him to be lady catherine's nephew it will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him
that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in
consequence to begin the acquaintance mr collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she
ceased speaking replied thus
my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those
which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look
on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though
in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if
hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology
hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh it vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak replied
with an air of distant civility mr collins however was not
discouraged from speaking again and mr darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr
collins then returned to elizabeth
i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my
reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered
me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying
that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very
handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to
made her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of
endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to
venture near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to
supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely
openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be
soon married to mr bingley it was an animating subject and mrs
bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match his being such a charming young man and so rich and living
but three miles from them were the first points of self-gratulation
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger
daughters as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on
such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life she
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical
what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing he may not like to hear
for heaven's sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you
to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing
nothing that she could say however had any influence her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed
and blushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequently
glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her the expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken
elizabeth now began to revive but not long was the interval of
tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she
had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty
preparing to oblige the company by many significant looks and silent
entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song
elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute
began another mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display
her voice was weak and her manner affected elizabeth was in agonies
she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly
talking to bingley she looked at his two sisters and saw them making
signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however
impenetrably grave she looked at her father to entreat his
interference lest mary should be singing all night he took the hint
and when mary had finished her second song said aloud
that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit
mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and
elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father's speech was afraid
her anxiety had done no good others of the party were now applied to
if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i
should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an
air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean however to
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the
rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care
and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible and i do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot
acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many
stared many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet
himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having
spoken so sensibly and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas that
he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed that his two sisters and mr darcy however should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or
the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement she was teazed by
mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her
power to dance with others in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening there was no arguing upon such a project she owed
her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and
good-naturedly engaged mr collins's conversation to herself
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy's farther notice
though often standing within a very short distance of her quite
disengaged he never came near enough to speak she felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in
it
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a
manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family mrs hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves they repulsed
every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a
languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests darcy said
nothing at all mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene
mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the
rest and talked only to each other elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord
how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and
addressed herself particularly to mr bingley to assure him how happy
he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time
without the ceremony of a formal invitation bingley was all grateful
pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four
months of having another daughter married to mr collins she thought
with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each
was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield
chapter xix
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn mr collins made his
declaration in form having resolved to do it without loss of time as
his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business on finding
mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon
after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words
may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mrs
bennet instantly answered
oh dear yes certainly i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am
sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up stairs and
gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth
called out
dear ma'am do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse
me he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear i am
going away myself
no no nonsense lizzy i desire you will stay where you are and
upon elizabeth's seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about
to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing
mr collins
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as
soon as they were gone mr collins began
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from
doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little
unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected
mother's permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as
soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my
future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife as i certainly did
the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away
with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and
he continued
my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example
of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have
mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this
subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left
hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was
arranging miss de bourgh's foot-stool that she said 'mr collins you
must marry a clergyman like you must marry chuse properly chuse a
gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active
useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small
income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as
you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her' allow me by the
way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and
kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any
thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be
acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views
were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i
assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that
being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that
the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy
event takes place which however as i have already said may not be
for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well
aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head
therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now
you are too hasty sir she cried you forget that i have made no
answer let me do it without farther loss of time accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the
hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their
favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not
one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me
happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation
were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr collins
very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you and you may be certain that when i have the honour of
seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty
economy and other amiable qualifications
indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must
give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of
believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by
refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn
estate whenever it falls without any self-reproach this matter may be
considered therefore as finally settled and rising as she thus
spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus
addressed her
when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character
really mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me
exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one
you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for
believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would
be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections
with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are
circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females
i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but
to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect
forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart
you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward
gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no
reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female
chapter xx
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she
entered the breakfast-room and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection mr collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character
this information however startled mrs bennet she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe
it and could not help saying so
but depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall be
brought to reason i will speak to her about it myself directly she is
a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but
i will make her know it
pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she
is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of
temper she could not contribute much to my felicity
sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these in every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr bennet and
we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure
she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her
husband called out as she entered the library
oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will
not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have her
mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication
i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had
finished her speech of what are you talking
of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins
and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy
and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business
speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him
let her be called down she shall hear my opinion
mrs bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
library
come here child cried her father as she appeared i have sent for
you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made
you an offer of marriage is it true elizabeth replied that it was
very well and this offer of marriage you have refused
i have sir
very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your
accepting it is not it so mrs bennet
yes or i will never see her again
an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you
again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again
if you do
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning
but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished was excessively disappointed
what do you mean mr bennet by talking in this way you promised me
to insist upon her marrying him
my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request
first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be
not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did
mrs bennet give up the point she talked to elizabeth again and again
coaxed and threatened her by turns she endeavoured to secure jane in
her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her manner
varied however her determination never did
mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other
way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend
the day with them she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to
her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such
fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr collins has
made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him
charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty
who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on
the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating
her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone
for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used
nobody feels for my poor nerves
charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth
aye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned
as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided
she can have her own way but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way
you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead i shall not be able to keep
you and so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i
told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you
again and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in
talking to undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i
suffer but it is always so those who do not complain are never
pitied
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation
she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by mr collins who entered with an air more stately
than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls
now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and
let mr collins and me have a little conversation together
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but
lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte
detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little
curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected
conversation oh mr collins 
my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point
far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i
trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation
you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
from your daughter's lips instead of your own but we are all liable to
error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner
has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise
chapter xxi
the discussion of mr collins's offer was now nearly at an end and
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother
as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not
by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke to
her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and
especially to her friend
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennet's ill humour or ill
health mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone on
saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay
after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham
were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was
well talked over to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed
i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet
mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so
many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with
them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came
from netherfield and was opened immediately the envelope contained a
sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady's
fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but
elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave
than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs when they
had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said
this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a
good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are
on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again
you shall hear what she says
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly
and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr
hurst had a house the next was in these words i do not pretend to
regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my
dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence i depend on you for that to these high
flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she
saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their
absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley's being there and as
to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon
cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by
them
caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you 
when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which
took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we
are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when
charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have
determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest
friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i
despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of
whom we shall deprive you
it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this
winter
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should
why will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master
but you do not know all i will read you the passage which
particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you mr darcy
is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are
scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana
darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the
affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into
something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the
country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart with all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest
jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many
what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy said jane as she
finished it is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare
that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to
put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject
yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it
most willingly
you shall have it in few words miss bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you
jane shook her head
indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is
not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy
for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is
this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the
more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that
when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in
achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i
dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but
my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your
representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the
foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived
herself
that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you
will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means
you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer
but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere
you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature
deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by
all means to refuse him
how can you talk so said jane faintly smiling you must know that
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could
not hesitate
i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider
your situation with much compassion
but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be
required a thousand things may arise in six months
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's
interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man
so totally independent of every one
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect
jane's temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after
lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking
that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though
he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have
two full courses
chapter xxii
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the
chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her it keeps him in good
humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was
very amiable but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth
had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her
from any return of mr collins's addresses by engaging them towards
herself such was miss lucas's scheme and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next
morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw
himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins
from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to
conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost
secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday his
reception however was of the most flattering kind miss lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there
in as short a time as mr collins's long speeches would allow every
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they
entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be
waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
happiness the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that
establishment were gained
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom
they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer
mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided
opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the
longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at st james's the whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes
of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's
dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had
gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were
in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be
imaginary but still he would be her husband without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their
pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now
obtained and at the age of twenty-seven without having ever been
handsome she felt all the good luck of it the least agreeable
circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to
elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though
her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation she resolved to give her the information herself and
therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family a promise
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept
without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some
ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great
self-denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his
other engagements might allow him to visit them
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly
gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you
may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible
they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return immediately said
but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here my
good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness
my dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence
you cannot be too much on your guard risk any thing rather than her
displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home
and be satisfied that we shall take no offence
believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting
my cousin elizabeth
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return mrs bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no
means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her's he might become a very
agreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of this
kind was done away miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before
the possibility of mr collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but
that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from
possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out
engaged to mr collins my dear charlotte impossible
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon
regained her composure and calmly replied
why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible
that mr collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you
but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort
for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness
i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be
surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to
marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you
will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i
never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collins's
character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause
they returned to the rest of the family charlotte did not stay much
longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match the strangeness of mr collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being
now accepted she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mr collins
was a most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen
chapter xxiii
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what
she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it
when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family with many compliments to them
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering
but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than
politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always
unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed
good lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know
that mr collins wants to marry lizzy
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment but sir william's good breeding carried
him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she
was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character
of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent in the first place she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins
had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy
together and fourthly that the match might be broken off two
inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that
elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day nothing could
console and nothing appease her nor did that day wear out her
resentment a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without
scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william
or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter
mr bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for
it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and
more foolish than his daughter
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable kitty and
lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a
clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at meryton
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was
though mrs bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again her
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as
bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promised
letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their
father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted after discharging
his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many
rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither
he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine
he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men
mr collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to mrs bennet on the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband it was very strange that he should come
to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome she hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and they
gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley's continued
absence
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to
netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs
bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood
even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its
frequently recurring the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss
darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for
the strength of his attachment
as for jane her anxiety under this suspence was of course more
painful than elizabeth's but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject
was never alluded to but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her
impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he
did not come back she should think herself very ill used it needed all
jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his
reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction he was too happy however to need much attention
and luckily for the others the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company the chief of every day was spent by
him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state the very mention of any
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sight of
miss lucas was odious to her as her successor in that house she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence whenever charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead she
complained bitterly of all this to her husband
indeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to
make way for her and live to see her take my place in it
my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for
better things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of
making any answer she went on as before
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was
not for the entail i should not mind it
what should not you mind
i should not mind any thing at all
let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility
i never can be thankful mr bennet for any thing about the entail
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
one's own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr
collins too why should he have it more than anybody else
i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet

chapter i
miss bingley's letter arrived and put an end to doubt the very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for
the winter and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left
the country
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of
the letter she found little except the professed affection of the
writer that could give her any comfort miss darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of mr darcy's house and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this
heard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concern
for her sister and resentment against all the others to caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no
credit that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she
had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she
could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness
of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations had his own happiness however been
the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best but her sister's was involved in it as she
thought he must be sensible himself it was a subject in short on
which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing she
could think of nothing else and yet whether bingley's regard had really
died away or were suppressed by his friends' interference whether he
had been aware of jane's attachment or whether it had escaped his
observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference her sister's situation remained
the same her peace equally wounded
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
elizabeth but at last on mrs bennet's leaving them together after a
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could
not help saying
oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i
will not repine it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shall
all be as we were before
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said
nothing
you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no
reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear
and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a
little time therefore i shall certainly try to get the better
with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself
my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to
you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you
deserve
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection
nay said elizabeth this is not fair you wish to think all the
world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body i only
want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be
afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people
whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see
of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention
the other is charlotte's marriage it is unaccountable in every view it
is unaccountable
my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will
ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper consider mr collins's respectability and
charlotte's prudent steady character remember that she is one of a
large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be
ready to believe for every body's sake that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin
to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that
charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her
understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is
a conceited pompous narrow-minded silly man you know he is as well
as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries
him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her
though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one
individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and
insensibility of danger security for happiness
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied
jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
together but enough of this you alluded to something else you
mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat
you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and
saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than
it does
and men take care that they should
if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine
i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley's conduct to design
said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others
unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness
want of attention to other people's feelings and want of resolution
will do the business
and do you impute it to either of those
yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what
i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can
you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him
yes in conjunction with his friend
i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can
only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can
secure it
your first position is false they may wish many things besides his
happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great
connections and pride
beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane
but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have
known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love
her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's what sister would think
herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very
objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try
to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an
affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most
unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been
mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of
what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it
in the best light in the light in which it may be understood
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw
her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs bennet's best
comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer
mr bennet treated the matter differently so lizzy said he one day
your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to
being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then
it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be
long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough at
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham
be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably
thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not
all expect jane's good fortune
true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it
mr wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
family they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve the whole of what elizabeth had already
heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of
hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else
mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men
chapter ii
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of
saturday the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his
side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason
to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men he took leave
of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father
another letter of thanks
on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at
longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentleman-like man greatly
superior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well
bred and agreeable mrs gardiner who was several years younger than
mrs bennet and mrs philips was an amiable intelligent elegant
woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces between the
two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular
regard they had frequently been staying with her in town
the first part of mrs gardiner's business on her arrival was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions when this was
done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listen
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of they
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing
in it
i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr
bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think
that she might have been mr collins's wife by this time had not it
been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room
and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have
a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed
sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of
them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted
so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of
long sleeves
mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in
the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her made her
sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the
conversation
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject it
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she i am
sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such
as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets
her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not
do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before
but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed so
doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance
as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingley's
love
i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite
inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time
they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i
spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be
finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love
oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor
jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get
over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of
service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence
i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of
town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go
out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all
unless he really comes to see her
and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his
friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a
part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may
perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley
never stirs without him
so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane
correspond with the sister she will not be able to help calling
she will drop the acquaintance entirely
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being
withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that
his affection might be re-animated and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's
attractions
miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure and the
bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she
hoped that by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother
she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of
seeing him
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses
the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its
engagement mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner when the engagement was for home some of the officers always
made part of it of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and
on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeth's
warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both without supposing
them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she
resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left
hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment
to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure
unconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago
before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of derbyshire to which he belonged they had therefore many
acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since
the death of darcy's father five years before it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had
been in the way of procuring
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by
character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the
minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was
delighting both him and herself on being made acquainted with the
present mr darcy's treatment of him she tried to remember something of
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree
with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard
mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill-natured
boy
chapter iii
mrs gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after
honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on
you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking
openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve
yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against
him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he
ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you
must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all
expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and
good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father
my dear aunt this is being serious indeed
yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise
well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of
myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i
can prevent it
elizabeth you are not serious now
i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with
mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison
the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to
me i believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence
of it oh that abominable mr darcy my father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my
father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but
since we see every day that where there is affection young people are
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not
to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short
i will do my best
perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him
as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very
true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine
that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week you know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon my
honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you
are satisfied
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point without being resented
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases
his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet his marriage was
now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that
she wished they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding day
and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose
to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her
out of the room as they went down stairs together charlotte said
i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza
that you certainly shall
and i have another favour to ask will you come and see me
we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire
i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to
come to hunsford
elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit
my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and
i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be
as welcome to me as either of them
the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the
sake of what had been rather than what was charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would
like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen she
wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise the house furniture neighbourhood and
roads were all to her taste and lady catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging it was mr collins's picture of hunsford and
rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there to know the rest
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
hearing from caroline she accounted for it however by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been
lost
my aunt she continued is going to-morrow into that part of the
town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor-street
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley
i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very
glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her
i enquired after their brother of course he was well but so much
engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that
miss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was
not long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out i dare say i shall
soon see them here
elizabeth shook her head over this letter it convinced her that
accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister's being in town
four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him she endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be
blind to miss bingley's inattention after waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the
visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more
the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no
longer the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
prove what she felt
 my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in
 her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have
 been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me but my
 dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me
 obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour
 was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion i do not at
 all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but
 if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should
 be deceived again caroline did not return my visit till yesterday
 and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time when
 she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it
 she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said
 not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so
 altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly
 resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity though i
 cannot help blaming her she was very wrong in singling me out as
 she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
 her side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been
 acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her
 brother is the cause of it i need not explain myself farther and
 though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she
 feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so
 deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may
 feel on his behalf is natural and amiable i cannot but wonder
 however at her having any such fears now because if he had at
 all cared about me we must have met long long ago he knows of my
 being in town i am certain from something she said herself and
 yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to
 persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy i cannot
 understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should
 be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of
 duplicity in all this but i will endeavour to banish every painful
 thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection
 and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear
 from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never
 returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not
 with any certainty we had better not mention it i am extremely
 glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
 hunsford pray go to see them with sir william and maria i am
 sure you will be very comfortable there
 your's c
this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she
considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over she would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions his character sunk on every
review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible
advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr
darcy's sister as by wickham's account she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over
he was the admirer of some one else elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune
permitted it the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable but elizabeth less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
in charlotte's did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence
nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very
sincerely wish him happy
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating the
circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt
that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that
pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name
and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial
towards him they are even impartial towards miss king i cannot find
out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my
watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love
with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly kitty and lydia take
his defection much more to heart than i do they are young in the ways
of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the
plain
chapter iv
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold did january and february pass away march was to take
elizabeth to hunsford she had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty absence had increased her desire of seeing
charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr collins there was
novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give her
a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have
been very sorry for any delay every thing however went on smoothly
and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch she was
to accompany sir william and his second daughter the improvement of
spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became
perfect as plan could be
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her
and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he
told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on
his side even more his present pursuit could not make him forget that
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the
first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner
of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what
she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their
opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide
there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her
to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced
that whether married or single he must always be her model of the
amiable and pleasing
her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good
humoured girl but as empty-headed as himself had nothing to say that
could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight
as the rattle of the chaise elizabeth loved absurdities but she had
known sir william's too long he could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn
out like his information
it was a journey of only twenty-four miles and they began it so early
as to be in gracechurch-street by noon as they drove to mr gardiner's
door jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth
looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room and whose shyness as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower all was joy and
kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and
shopping and the evening at one of the theatres
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt their first subject was her
sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to
her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her
spirits there were periods of dejection it was reasonable however to
hope that they would not continue long mrs gardiner gave her the
particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the
acquaintance
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion and
complimented her on bearing it so well
but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary
pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs
between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end
and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me
because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is
mercenary
if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know
what to think
she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her
but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's
death made her mistress of this fortune
no why should he if it was not allowable for him to gain my
affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally
poor
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so
soon after this event
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it
why should we
her not objecting does not justify him it only shews her being
deficient in something herself sense or feeling
well cried elizabeth have it as you choose he shall be
mercenary and she shall be foolish
no lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire
oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going to-morrow
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing after all
take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs
gardiner but perhaps to the lakes
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful my dear dear
aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me
fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen what are men
to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and
when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing we will know where
we have gone we will recollect what we have seen lakes mountains
and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when
we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation let our first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers
chapter v
every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in
search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants
at length the parsonage was discernible the garden sloping to the road
the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every
thing declared they were arriving mr collins and charlotte appeared at
the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a
short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
party in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the
sight of each other mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when
she found herself so affectionately received she saw instantly that her
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility
was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family they were then
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance
taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble
abode and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect
and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when mr
collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed
which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on
charlotte once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general
charlotte wisely did not hear after sitting long enough to admire every
article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london
mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large
and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and
elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked
of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible here leading the way through every walk and cross
walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind he could number the fields in every direction
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump but
of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom
could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house it was a handsome modern building well
situated on rising ground
from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two meadows
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased
probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help it was rather small but well built and convenient and every
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr collins could be
forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by
charlotte's evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country it
was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining
in observed
yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will
be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
charming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to
walk home her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us i
should say one of her ladyship's carriages for she has several
lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added
charlotte and a most attentive neighbour
very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and
telling again what had been already written and when it closed
elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
charlotte's degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding
and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious
interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with
rosings a lively imagination soon settled it all
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up
stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her she opened the
door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with
agitation cried out
oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the dining-room for
there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make
haste and come down this moment
elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more
and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane in quest
of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate
and is this all cried elizabeth i expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
daughter
la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady
catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the
other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little
creature who would have thought she could be so thin and small
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind
why does she not come in
oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours
when miss de bourgh comes in
i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas she
looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will
make him a very proper wife
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeth's high
diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the
greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh
looked that way
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and
the others returned into the house mr collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which
charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at rosings the next day
chapter vi
mr collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady
catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough
i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
rosings i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it
would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after
your arrival
i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william
from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but
their visit to rosings mr collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many
servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth
do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and daughter i would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion
for any thing more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved
while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different
doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner such formidable accounts of
her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas
who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her
introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had
done to his presentation at st james's
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park every park has its beauty and its prospects and
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such
raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost sir lewis de bourgh
when they ascended the steps to the hall maria's alarm was every
moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly
calm elizabeth's courage did not fail her she had heard nothing of
lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she
thought she could witness without trepidation
from the entrance hall of which mr collins pointed out with a
rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed
the servants through an anti-chamber to the room where lady catherine
her daughter and mrs jenkinson were sitting her ladyship with great
condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's it was
performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary
in spite of having been at st james's sir william was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word
and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge
of her chair not knowing which way to look elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly lady catherine was a tall large woman with
strongly-marked features which might once have been handsome her air
was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to
make her visitors forget their inferior rank she was not rendered
formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so
authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance and brought mr
wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind and from the observation of the
day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had
represented
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the
daughter she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment at her
being so thin and so small there was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her
features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very
little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows
to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its
beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much
better worth looking at in the summer
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants
and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he
had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by
her ladyship's desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater he carved and ate and praised with delighted
alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir
william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and
gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them the party did not supply much conversation elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated
between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in
listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she
were indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room there was little to be
done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted she enquired into charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice
as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her's and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady's attention which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others in the intervals of her discourse with
mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and
elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew
the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel
pretty kind of girl she asked her at different times how many sisters
she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of
them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they
had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her
mother's maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions but answered them very composedly lady catherine then
observed
your father's estate is entailed on mr collins i think for your
sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line it was not thought
necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family do you play and sing miss
bennet
a little
oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you our
instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it
some day do your sisters play and sing
one of them does
why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned the miss
webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as
your's do you draw
no not at all
what none of you
not one
that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters
my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london
has your governess left you
we never had any governess
no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home
without a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education
elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not
been the case
then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must
have been neglected
compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to
read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be
idle certainly might
aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had
known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is
wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that
way i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four nieces
of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and
it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite
delighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfe's
calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure 'lady
catherine' said she 'you have given me a treasure' are any of your
younger sisters out miss bennet
yes ma'am all
all what all five out at once very odd and you only the
second the younger ones out before the elder are married your
younger sisters must be very young
yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much
in company but really ma'am i think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind
upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age
with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence
you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not
conceal your age
i am not one and twenty
when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables
were placed lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins sat
down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her
party their table was superlatively stupid scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson
expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold or
having too much or too little light a great deal more passed at the
other table lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes
of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself mr collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her
for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many
sir william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose
the tables were broke up the carriage was offered to mrs collins
gratefully accepted and immediately ordered the party then gathered
round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow from these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr
collins's side and as many bows on sir william's they departed as
soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her
cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which
for charlotte's sake she made more favourable than it really was but
her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means
satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's
praise into his own hands
chapter vii
sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough
to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled and of
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he
went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and
elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading
and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which
fronted the road the room in which the ladies sat was backwards
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a
pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and
she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and
were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton
which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened
almost every day she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had
a few minutes' conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits she examined into their employments looked at their work
and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she
accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that mrs collins's joints of meat were too large for her family
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
mr collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold
them into harmony and plenty
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week
and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card
table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of
the first their other engagements were few as the style of living of
the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses' reach this
however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors her favourite walk and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was
a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and
where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be
important elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him
were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined
by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
miss lucas and herself
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane
in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow
as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great
intelligence on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his
respects there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for
mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of
his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when
mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room crossing the road and immediately running
into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding
i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment
before their approach was announced by the door-bell and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room colonel fitzwilliam
who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and
address most truly the gentleman mr darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual
reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend met her with every appearance of composure elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him without saying a word
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man and talked very pleasantly but
his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to mrs collins sat for some time without speaking to any body
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
elizabeth after the health of her family she answered him in the usual
way and after a moment's pause added
my eldest sister has been in town these three months have you never
happened to see her there
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet the
subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away
chapter viii
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at rosings it was some days however before they
received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the
house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter-day
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival that they were honoured by
such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening for the last week they had seen very little
of either lady catherine or her daughter colonel fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had
only seen at church
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined
the party in lady catherine's drawing-room her ladyship received them
civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact
almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy
much more than to any other person in the room
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a
welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much he now seated himself by her and
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying
at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as
well as of mr darcy his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not
scruple to call out
what is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talking
of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is
we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid
a reply
of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt i
should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health
had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed
delightfully how does georgiana get on darcy
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady
catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel
if she does not practise a great deal
i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice
she practises very constantly
so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write
to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired
without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that
she will never play really well unless she practises more and though
mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often
told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano-forte in
mrs jenkinson's room she would be in nobody's way you know in that
part of the house
mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding and made
no answer
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument he
drew a chair near her lady catherine listened to half a song and then
talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from
her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first
convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said
you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear
me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me
i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact
are not your own
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to
colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a
part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me
leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate
and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear
i am not afraid of you said he smilingly
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel
fitzwilliam i should like to know how he behaves among strangers
you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know
was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced
only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only
four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr
darcy you cannot deny the fact
i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party
true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel
fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders
perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an
introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth still
addressing colonel fitzwilliam shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers
i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to
him it is because he will not give himself the trouble
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy
of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot
catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their
concerns as i often see done
my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which i see so many women's do they have not the same
force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i
have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the
trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution
darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right you have employed your
time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think any thing wanting we neither of us perform to strangers
here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know
what they were talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said
to darcy
miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and
could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion
of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne's anne would have
been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have
been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home
chapter ix
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane
while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village
when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a
visitor as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be
lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions
when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr
darcy only entered the room
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence it was absolutely
necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence
recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure she observed
how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you
all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day
before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london
perfectly so i thank you
she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short
pause added
i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to netherfield again
i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing
if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we
might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle
i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers
elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking longer of his
friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him
he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable
house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr
collins first came to hunsford
i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object
mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife
yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made
him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though
i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest
thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a
prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends
an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles
and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a day's
journey yes i call it a very easy distance
i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages
of the match cried elizabeth i should never have said mrs collins
was settled near her family
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far
as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she
understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
netherfield and she blushed as she answered
i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many
varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the
case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my
friend would not call herself near her family under less than half
the present distance
mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot have
been always at longbourn
elizabeth looked surprised the gentleman experienced some change of
feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and
glancing over it said in a colder voice
are you pleased with kent
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side
calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
and her sister just returned from their walk the tte tte surprised
them mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to any body went away
what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was
gone my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have
called on us in this familiar way
but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely
even to charlotte's wishes to be the case and after various
conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable
from the time of year all field sports were over within doors there
was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the
pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes
separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their
aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her
former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners
she believed he might have the best informed mind
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult
to understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to
propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom appeared really
animated mrs collins knew not what to make of him colonel
fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was
generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out she watched him whenever they were at
rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success he
certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that
look was disputable it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs
collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend's dislike would
vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power
in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying
colonel fitzwilliam he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he
certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but
to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage
in the church and his cousin could have none at all
chapter x
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly
meet mr darcy she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that
should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever
happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a
favourite haunt of hers how it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd yet it did and even a third it seemed like wilful
ill-nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her he never
said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in
being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr
and mrs collins's happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her
not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever
she came into kent again she would be staying there too his words
seemed to imply it could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts
she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what
might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the
parsonage
she was engaged one day as she walked in re-perusing jane's last
letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not
written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy
she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said
i did not know before that you ever walked this way
i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally
do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage are
you going much farther
no i should have turned in a moment
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage
together
do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she
yes if darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he
arranges the business just as he pleases
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know any body who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy
he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam
but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than
many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak
feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to self-denial and
dependence
in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either now seriously what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for
these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have
experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater
weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons cannot marry
where they like
unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often
do
our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money
is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the
idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is
the usual price of an earl's younger son unless the elder brother is
very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed
she soon afterwards said
i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well
for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he
likes with her
no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must
divide with me i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy
are you indeed and pray what sort of guardians do you make does your
charge give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she
may like to have her own way
as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth she directly replied
you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and
miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them
i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man he is a great friend of darcy's
oh yes said elizabeth drily mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr
bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him
care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in
those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in
our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to
him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that
bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture
what is it you mean
it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known because if it were to get round to the lady's family
it would be an unpleasant thing
you may depend upon my not mentioning it
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other
particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer
did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady
and what arts did he use to separate them
he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling he
only told me what i have now told you
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with
indignation after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge
you are rather disposed to call his interference officious
i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy but
she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the
particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case
that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly
this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of
mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and
therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage there shut into her own room
as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard it was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected there
could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have
such boundless influence that he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate mr bingley and jane she had never doubted but she
had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them if his own vanity however did not mislead him
he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that
jane had suffered and still continued to suffer he had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart
in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel
fitzwilliam's words and these strong objections probably were her
having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in
business in london
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of
objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding
excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating neither could
any thing be urged against my father who though with some
peculiarities has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain
and respectability which he will probably never reach when she thought
of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would
not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr
darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend's connections than from their want
of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of
retaining mr bingley for his sister
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a
headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to
her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her
cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea mrs collins
seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collins
could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home
chapter xi
when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
being in kent they contained no actual complaint nor was there any
revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal mr darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings it was some consolation to
think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next
and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits by all that affection could do
she could not think of darcy's leaving kent without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not
mean to be unhappy about him
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in
the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her but
this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently
affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the
room in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better
she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and
then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but said
not a word after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
agitated manner and thus began
in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be
repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love
you
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloured
doubted and was silent this he considered sufficient encouragement
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her
immediately followed he spoke well but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiority of
its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had
always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost
all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to
answer him with patience when he should have done he concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of
all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of
a favourable answer he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his
countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her
cheeks and she said
in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however
unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be
felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i
cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of
short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the
acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming
it after this explanation
mr darcy who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for the
appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it the pause was to elizabeth's feelings
dreadful at length in a voice of forced calmness he said
and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i
might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at
civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance
i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of
offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will against your reason and even against your character
was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have
other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided
against you had they been indifferent or had they even been
favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the
happiness of a most beloved sister
as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion
was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not
you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means
of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity
can you deny that you have done it she repeated
with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying
that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been
kinder than towards myself
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection
but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her
but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike
is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to
say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others
you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns said darcy in
a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an
interest in him
his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes
have been great indeed
and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy you have reduced
him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule
and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room
is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i
thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this
calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his
walk and turning towards her these offences might have been
overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these
bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy
concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being
impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by
reflection by every thing but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life
is so decidedly beneath my own
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said
you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the
concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued
you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it
again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification she went on
from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my
acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others were such as to form that ground-work of
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a
dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry
you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your
feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not how to
support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
hour her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was
increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer of
marriage from mr darcy that he should have been in love with her for
so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her
sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case
was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
so strong an affection but his pride his abominable pride his
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady
catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
charlotte's observation and hurried her away to her room
chapter xii
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes she could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing
else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise she was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park
she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road
the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed
one of the gates into the ground
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was
tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and
look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had
made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr
darcy she was directly retreating but the person who advanced was now
near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced
her name she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in
a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the
gate he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter
which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you
will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then with a
slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of
sight
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity
elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written
quite through in a very close hand the envelope itself was likewise
full pursuing her way along the lane she then began it it was dated
from rosings at eight o'clock in the morning and was as follows 
 be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the
 apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments
 or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to
 you i write without any intention of paining you or humbling
 myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both
 cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation
 and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been
 spared had not my character required it to be written and read
 you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your
 attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i
 demand it of your justice
 two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal
 magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned
 was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached
 mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in
 defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity
 ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr
 wickham wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
 my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who
 had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who
 had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity
 to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could
 be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison but
 from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
 bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in
 future secured when the following account of my actions and their
 motives has been read if in the explanation of them which is
 due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which
 may be offensive to your's i can only say that i am sorry the
 necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd i
 had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with
 others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other
 young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the
 dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a
 serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that
 ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made
 acquainted by sir william lucas's accidental information that
 bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
 expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event
 of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i
 observed my friend's behaviour attentively and i could then
 perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had
 ever witnessed in him your sister i also watched her look and
 manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any
 symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the
 evening's scrutiny that though she received his attentions with
 pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of
 sentiment if you have not been mistaken here i must have
 been in an error your superior knowledge of your sister must make
 the latter probable if it be so if i have been misled by such
 error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been
 unreasonable but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity
 of your sister's countenance and air was such as might have given
 the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her
 temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was
 desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will
 venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually
 influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be
 indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial
 conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to
 the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged
 to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my
 own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
 my friend as to me but there were other causes of
 repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to
 an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to
 forget because they were not immediately before me these causes
 must be stated though briefly the situation of your mother's
 family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that
 total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed
 by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by
 your father pardon me it pains me to offend you but amidst
 your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your
 displeasure at this representation of them let it give you
 consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to
 avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally
 bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to
 the sense and disposition of both i will only say farther that
 from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was
 confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me
 before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy
 connection he left netherfield for london on the day following
 as you i am certain remember with the design of soon
 returning the part which i acted is now to be explained his
 sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our
 coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible
 that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly
 resolved on joining him directly in london we accordingly
 went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
 my friend the certain evils of such a choice i described and
 enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrance might have
 staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it
 would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been
 seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your
 sister's indifference he had before believed her to return his
 affection with sincere if not with equal regard but bingley has
 great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment
 than on his own to convince him therefore that he had deceived
 himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against
 returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given
 was scarcely the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for
 having done thus much there is but one part of my conduct in the
 whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is
 that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
 conceal from him your sister's being in town i knew it myself as
 it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant
 of it that they might have met without ill consequence is
 perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough
 extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this
 concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however
 and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more
 to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sister's
 feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which
 governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have
 not yet learnt to condemn them with respect to that other more
 weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only
 refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my
 family of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but
 of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one
 witness of undoubted veracity mr wickham is the son of a very
 respectable man who had for many years the management of all the
 pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
 trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on
 george wickham who was his god-son his kindness was therefore
 liberally bestowed my father supported him at school and
 afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own
 father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have
 been unable to give him a gentleman's education my father was not
 only fond of this young man's society whose manners were always
 engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the
 church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it
 as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think
 of him in a very different manner the vicious propensities the
 want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
 of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man
 of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of
 seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have
 here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell
 but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a
 suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
 real character it adds even another motive my excellent father
 died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to
 the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it
 to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
 profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a
 valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
 vacant there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own
 father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these
 events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally
 resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it
 unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary
 advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be
 benefited he had some intention he added of studying the law
 and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
 be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than
 believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to
 accede to his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a
 clergyman the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all
 claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could
 ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three
 thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i
 thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his
 society in town in town i believe he chiefly lived but his
 studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all
 restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation for
 about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the
 incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied
 to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he
 assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were
 exceedingly bad he had found the law a most unprofitable study
 and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would
 present him to the living in question of which he trusted there
 could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other
 person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered
 father's intentions you will hardly blame me for refusing to
 comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it
 his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
 circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
 to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every
 appearance of acquaintance was dropt how he lived i know not but
 last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice i
 must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget
 myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce
 me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no
 doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my
 junior was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew colonel
 fitzwilliam and myself about a year ago she was taken from
 school and an establishment formed for her in london and last
 summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate
 and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there
 proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs
 younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by
 her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana
 whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his
 kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe
 herself in love and to consent to an elopement she was then but
 fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her
 imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to
 herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
 intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea
 of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
 a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt
 and how i acted regard for my sister's credit and feelings
 prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left
 the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from
 her charge mr wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
 sister's fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot
 help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a
 strong inducement his revenge would have been complete indeed
 this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
 have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject
 it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty
 towards mr wickham i know not in what manner under what form of
 falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to
 be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of every thing
 concerning either detection could not be in your power and
 suspicion certainly not in your inclination you may possibly
 wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then
 master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed
 for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more
 particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our
 near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of
 the executors of my father's will has been unavoidably acquainted
 with every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of
 me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented
 by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may
 be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find
 some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course
 of the morning i will only add god bless you
 fitzwilliam darcy
chapter xiii
if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined with amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong
prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of
what had happened at netherfield she read with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes his belief of her sister's
insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of
the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have
any wish of doing him justice he expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty it
was all pride and insolence
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham when
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which
if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her she wished
to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false
this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood and when she had
gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not
regard it that she would never look in it again
in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on
nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly
what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy
though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his
own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to
the will the difference was great what wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err but when she read and re-read with the closest attention the
particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate she put down the
letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with
little success on both sides it was only assertion again she read on
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render mr darcy's conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
mr wickham's charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could
bring no proof of its injustice she had never heard of him before his
entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town
had there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of life
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself as to
his real character had information been in her power she had never
felt a wish of enquiring his countenance voice and manner had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue she tried to
recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr
darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance but no
such recollection befriended her she could see him instantly before
her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after
pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to
read but alas the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy
received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel
fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam
himself from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs and whose character she had no
reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr philips's
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was now
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and
wondered it had escaped her before she saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing mr darcy that mr darcy might leave the country but that
he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball
the very next week she remembered also that till the netherfield
family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but
herself but that after their removal it had been every where
discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr
darcy's character though he had assured her that respect for the
father would always prevent his exposing the son
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shewn every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter and in farther justification of mr darcy she could not
but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as
were his manners she had never in the whole course of their
acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had
his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and
that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man
as mr bingley was incomprehensible
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself of neither darcy nor wickham
could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial
prejudiced absurd
how despicably have i acted she cried i who have prided myself on
my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my
vanity in useless or blameable distrust how humiliating is this
discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could
not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my
folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect
of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted
prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were
concerned till this moment i never knew myself
from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy's explanation
there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widely
different was the effect of a second perusal how could she deny that
credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to
give in the other he declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment and she could not help
remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been neither could she
deny the justice of his description of jane she felt that jane's
feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great
sensibility
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense
of shame was severe the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first
disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt it soothed
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that
jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every
variety of thought re-considering events determining probabilities
and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and
so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her
at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of
appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each
called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take
leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found elizabeth could but just affect concern in
missing him she really rejoiced at it colonel fitzwilliam was no
longer an object she could think only of her letter
chapter xiv
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr collins having
been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very
good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings to rosings he then
hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return
brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had
she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her
future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been what would she have said how
would she have behaved were questions with which she amused herself
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party i assure
you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly
attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to
me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his
attachment to rosings certainly increases
mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of
spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon she added
but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your
company i am sure
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied
elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town
next saturday
why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expected
you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came there
can be no occasion for your going so soon mrs bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight
but my father cannot he wrote last week to hurry my return
oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stay
another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as
dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room
for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i
should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large
you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our
original plan
lady catherine seemed resigned
mrs collins you must send a servant with them you know i always
speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
post by themselves it is highly improper you must contrive to send
somebody i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended
according to their situation in life when my niece georgiana went to
ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go
with her miss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady
anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner i
am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john with
the young ladies mrs collins i am glad it occurred to me to mention
it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone
my uncle is to send a servant for us
oh your uncle he keeps a man-servant does he i am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change
horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell
you will be attended to
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey
and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary
which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so
occupied she might have forgotten where she was reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it
as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections
mr darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart she
studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different when she remembered the style of his address
she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against
herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she
could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again in her own past
behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin
they were hopeless of remedy her father contented with laughing at
them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right
herself was entirely insensible of the evil elizabeth had frequently
united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
and lydia but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence
what chance could there be of improvement catherine weak-spirited
irritable and completely under lydia's guidance had been always
affronted by their advice and lydia self-willed and careless would
scarcely give them a hearing they were ignorant idle and vain while
there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while
meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for
ever
anxiety on jane's behalf was another prevailing concern and mr
darcy's explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good
opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was
proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his
friend how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so
desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for
happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own
family
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's
character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spent
there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the
work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh
when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them
a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both
chapter xv
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode our plain
manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we
see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness she had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with
charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her
feel the obliged mr collins was gratified and with a more smiling
solemnity replied
it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that
your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation
with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on
what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in
truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble
parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of
compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was
obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences
you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into
hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so lady catherine's great attentions to mrs collins you
have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be
as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
thinking there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each
other
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to
such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to
ask for compassion her home and her housekeeping her parish and her
poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their
charms
at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels
placed within and it was pronounced to be ready after an affectionate
parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
mr collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his
compliments to mr and mrs gardiner though unknown he then handed her
in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when
he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings
but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here
elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and
the carriage drove off
good gracious cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but
a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have
happened
a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh
we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there
twice how much i shall have to tell
elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and
within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardiner's
house where they were to remain a few days
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them but jane was to go home with her and at
longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcy's proposals to know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate
and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into
repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister
farther
chapter xvi
it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out
together from gracechurch-street for the town of in hertfordshire
and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet's carriage was
to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachman's
punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up
stairs these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily
employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on
guard and dressing a sallad and cucumber
after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming
is not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise
and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the
money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there then shewing
her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it
is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any
better
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect
unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and
when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh i
think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what
one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they
are going in a fortnight
are they indeed cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction
they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme
and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all mamma would like to
go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have
yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed
and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole
campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton
now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to
table what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about
a certain person that we all like
jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he
need not stay lydia laughed and said
aye that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the
waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse
things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad
he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for
my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it
there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king there's for you she
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safe
and mary king is safe added elizabeth safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune
she is a great fool for going away if she liked him
but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane
i am sure there is not on his i will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her who could about such a nasty little freckled
thing
elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such
coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal
as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was
ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their
boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and
lydia's purchases were seated in it
how nicely we are crammed in cried lydia i am glad i bought my
bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now
let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way
home and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any
flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare
she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not
being married before three and twenty my aunt philips wants you so to
get husbands you can't think she says lizzy had better have taken mr
collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it lord
how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would
chaperon you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at colonel forster's kitty and me were to spend
the day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and so
she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen
was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we
dressed up chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a
lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but col and mrs
forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny
and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they
did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs
forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect
something and then they soon found out what was the matter
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia
assisted by kitty's hints and additions endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to longbourn elizabeth listened as little as she
could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name
their reception at home was most kind mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane
in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennet
say voluntarily to elizabeth
i am glad you are come back lizzy
their party in the dining-room was large for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects
which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs bennet was
doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other
retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice
rather louder than any other person's was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her
oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun
as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended
there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if
kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we
behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have
treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought
we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter
and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so
loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off
to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister
to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with
the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms
for me i should infinitely prefer a book
but of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to any
body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers there was
another reason too for her opposition she dreaded seeing wickham again
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible the comfort to her
of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression in
a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton
scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under
frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often
disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last
chapter xvii
elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr
darcy and herself
miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she was
sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly
ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment
indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me
you do not blame me however for refusing him
blame you oh no
but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham
no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did
but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very
next day
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned george wickham what a stroke was this for poor jane
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here
collected in one individual nor was darcy's vindication though
grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and
seek to clear one without involving the other
this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both
of them good for any thing take your choice but you must be satisfied
with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just
enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr
darcy's but you shall do as you chuse
it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she wickham so
very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only
consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of
his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it
so
oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion
makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will
be as light as a feather
poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the
appearance of it
i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you
used to do
and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him without any reason it is such a spur to one's genius such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually
abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty
lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now
indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very
uncomfortable i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to of what i
felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and
vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly
undeserved
certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is
one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i
ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
wickham's character
miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your own opinion
that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to
make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative
to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and
if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who
will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent
that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to
attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham
will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here
what he really is sometime hence it will be all found out and then we
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will
say nothing about it
you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to
re-establish a character we must not make him desperate
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation she had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight
and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish
to talk again of either but there was still something lurking behind
of which prudence forbad the disclosure she dared not relate the other
half of mr darcy's letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend here was knowledge in which no one could
partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
last incumbrance of mystery and then said she if that very
improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell
what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value
she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits jane was not happy she still cherished a
very tender affection for bingley having never even fancied herself in
love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from
her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to
every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity
well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now of
this sad business of jane's for my part i am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody i told my sister philips so the other day but i
cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london well he is a
very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his
coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every
body too who is likely to know
i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more
oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was
her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure
jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he
has done
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation
she made no answer
well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the
collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it
will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an
excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother
she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their
housekeeping i dare say
no nothing at all
a great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes they will
take care not to outrun their income they will never be distressed
for money well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often
talk of having longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it
quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens
it was a subject which they could not mention before me
no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better i should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me
chapter xviii
the first week of their return was soon gone the second began it was
the last of the regiment's stay in meryton and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace the dejection was almost
universal the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink
and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family
good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe how can you be smiling so
lizzy
their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years
ago
i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel
millar's regiment went away i thought i should have broke my heart
i am sure i shall break mine said lydia
if one could but go to brighton observed mrs bennet
oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so
disagreeable
a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever
and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good
added kitty
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
longbourn-house elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame she felt anew the justice of mr darcy's
objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away for she
received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the
regiment to accompany her to brighton this invaluable friend was a
very young woman and very lately married a resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of
their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two
the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster
the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely
to be described wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every one's
congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish
i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia
said she though i am not her particular friend i have just as much
right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make
her resigned as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general
behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must
be greater than at home he heard her attentively and then said
lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances
if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to
us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you
would judge differently in the affair
already arisen repeated mr bennet what has she frightened away
some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly
indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not
of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining our
importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
lydia's character excuse me for i must speak plainly if you my dear
father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character
will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous a flirt too in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty
is also comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain
ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled oh my dear father can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and
affectionately taking her hand said in reply
do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known
you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly
sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will
keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to any body at brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find
women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow
many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion
continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry it was not
in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over
unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her
disposition
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility in lydia's imagination a visit to brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness she saw with the creative eye of
fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers she
saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown she saw all the glories of the camp its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young
and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she
saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these what would have been her sensations they could
have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the
same lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there
himself
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving
home
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time having been
frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty
well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so she had even
learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary in his present
behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after
what had since passed to provoke her she lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever
cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal
on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton he dined
with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she
mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr darcy's having both spent three
weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen
him often and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man
asked her how she had liked him her answer was warmly in his favour
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you
say that he was at rosings
nearly three weeks
and you saw him frequently
yes almost every day
his manners are very different from his cousin's
yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance
indeed cried wickham with a look which did not escape her and pray
may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in
address that he improves has he deigned to add ought of civility to his
ordinary style for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more
serious tone that he is improved in essentials
oh no said elizabeth in essentials i believe he is very much
what he ever was
while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning there was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention while she added
when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from
knowing him better his disposition was better understood
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his
embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of
accents
you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily
comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the appearance of what is right his pride in that direction
may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that
the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i
know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he
has very much at heart
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head she saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge
him the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side
of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish
elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton
from whence they were to set out early the next morning the separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic kitty was the
only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy mrs
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous
happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard
chapter xix
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her respect
esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown but mr bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice he was fond of
the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement this is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband she had always seen it with pain but
respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children was so highly reprehensible but she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents talents which rightly
used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment their parties
abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers
of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering
place and a camp upon the whole therefore she found what has been
sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward
with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself it was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the
present and prepare for another disappointment her tour to the lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her
mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in
the scheme every part of it would have been perfect
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for
were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain
but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized a scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and
always very short those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library where such and such officers
had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which
she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going to the
camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less
to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good
humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at longbourn everything wore
a happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter came
back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose mrs bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june
kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without
tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by
the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office another regiment should be quartered in
meryton
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter
arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent mr gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again
within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up
the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the
present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire in that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction the
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where
they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth
dovedale or the peak
elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing
the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough but it
was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy
and all was soon right again
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected it was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its
owner but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me
the period of expectation was now doubled four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt's arrival but they did pass away and mr and
mrs gardiner with their four children did at length appear at
longbourn the children two girls of six and eight years old and two
younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way teaching them playing with them and loving them
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next
morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement one
enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection
and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay oxford blenheim warwick kenelworth birmingham c are
sufficiently known a small part of derbyshire is all the present
concern to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardiner's
former residence and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of
lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated it
was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it in
talking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again mr gardiner declared his
willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation
my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much said her aunt a place too with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected wickham passed all his youth there you
know
elizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business at
pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she
must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the
grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the
country
elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce the
possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantly
occurred it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run
such a risk but against this there were objections and she finally
resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as
to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid
whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its
proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for
the summer a most welcome negative followed the last question and her
alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the
next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and
with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme
to pemberley therefore they were to go

chapter i
elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of
pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned
in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground they
entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view they gradually ascended for
half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by
pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which
the road with some abruptness wound it was a large handsome stone
building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned elizabeth was delighted she
had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste they were
all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of pemberley might be something
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and
while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of
meeting its owner returned she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken on applying to see the place they were admitted into the
hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was
the housekeeper came a respectable-looking elderly woman much less
fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her they
followed her into the dining-parlour it was a large well-proportioned
room handsomely fitted up elizabeth after slightly surveying it went
to a window to enjoy its prospect the hill crowned with wood from
which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the
distance was a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was
good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered
on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace
it with delight as they passed into other rooms these objects were
taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to
be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable
to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration
of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of
splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of
viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no recollecting
herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost
to me i should not have been allowed to invite them
this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really
absent but had not courage for it at length however the question was
asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs reynolds
replied that he was adding but we expect him to-morrow with a
large party of friends how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day
her aunt now called her to look at a picture she approached and saw
the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures
over the mantle-piece her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a
young gentleman the son of her late master's steward who had been
brought up by him at his own expence he is now gone into the army
she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not
return it
and that said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures
is my master and very like him it was drawn at the same time as the
other about eight years ago
i have heard much of your master's fine person said mrs gardiner
looking at the picture it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell
us whether it is like or not
mrs reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master
does that young lady know mr darcy
elizabeth coloured and said a little
and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ma'am
yes very handsome
i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late
master's favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then he was very fond of them
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham's being among them
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn
when she was only eight years old
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mr gardiner
oh yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so
accomplished she plays and sings all day long in the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she
comes here to-morrow with him
mr gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either
from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister
is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year
not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his
time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months
except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate
if your master would marry you might see more of him
yes sir but i do not know when that will be i do not know who is
good enough for him
mr and mrs gardiner smiled elizabeth could not help saying it is
very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so
i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows
him replied the other elizabeth thought this was going pretty far
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added
i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him
ever since he was four years old
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her
ideas that he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest
opinion her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more
and was grateful to her uncle for saying
there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in
having such a master
yes sir i know i am if i was to go through the world i could not
meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are
good-natured when children are good-natured when they grow up and he
was always the sweetest-tempered most generous-hearted boy in the
world
elizabeth almost stared at her can this be mr darcy thought she
his father was an excellent man said mrs gardiner
yes ma'am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just
as affable to the poor
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more mrs
reynolds could interest her on no other point she related the subject
of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the
furniture in vain mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase
he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever
lived not like the wild young men now-a-days who think of nothing but
themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never
saw any thing of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men
in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth
this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend
perhaps we might be deceived
that is not very likely our authority was too good
on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but
just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the
room when last at pemberley
he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards
one of the windows
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight when she should enter
the room and this is always the way with him she added whatever
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there
is nothing he would not do for her
the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bed-rooms were
all that remained to be shewn in the former were many good paintings
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already
visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
darcy's in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and
also more intelligible
in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her at last it
arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with
such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen
when he looked at her she stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his
father's life time
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth's mind a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds
was of no trifling nature what praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant as a brother a landlord a master she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship how
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow how much of
good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she
stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes
upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and
softened its impropriety of expression
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen
they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were
consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door
as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back
to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables
they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his
appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyes
instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from
surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party
and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least
of perfect civility
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw mr darcy the gardener's expression of surprise on
beholding his master must immediately have told it they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family amazed at the
alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few
minutes in which they continued together were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life nor did he seem much more at ease when he
spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his
enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay
in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few
moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took
leave
the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his
figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own
feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and
vexation her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill-judged
thing in the world how strange must it appear to him in what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected had they been
only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting and his behaviour so
strikingly altered what could it mean that he should even speak to
her was amazing but to speak with such civility to enquire after her
family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing's park when
he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think nor how to
account for it
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she
distinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then
was she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in
what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing
she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was
not like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with
composure
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while
ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of
the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods
overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream mr gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be
beyond a walk with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten
miles round it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed
circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among
hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts
they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of
the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and
the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the
stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed
the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardiner
who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece was
therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their
progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the
taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man
about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in this
slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth's astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy
approaching them and at no great distance the walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they
met elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an
interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness if he really intended to meet them for a few moments indeed
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path this idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the
turning past he was immediately before them with a glance she saw
that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his
politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place
but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when
some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of
pemberley from her might be mischievously construed her colour
changed and she said no more
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and
she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had
revolted in his offer to herself what will be his surprise thought
she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of
fashion
the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their
relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore
it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions that he was surprised by the
connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so
far from going away turned back with them and entered into
conversation with mr gardiner elizabeth could not but be pleased
could not but triumph it was consoling that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush she listened most
attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every
expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence
his taste or his good manners
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy
invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he
chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport mrs gardiner who was
walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her
wonder elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the
compliment must be all for herself her astonishment however was
extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered from
what can it proceed it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake
that his manners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not
work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love
me
after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two
gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant there chanced to be a little alteration it originated in
mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found
elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred
her husband's mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on
together after a short silence the lady first spoke she wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been
very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow and indeed before we
left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling they
will join me early to-morrow he continued and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when mr bingley's name had been last mentioned
between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was
not very differently engaged
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a
pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow
me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at lambton
the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it she immediately felt
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her
must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was
satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her
they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought elizabeth
was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and
pleased his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind they soon outstripped the others and when they had
reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind
he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not
tired and they stood together on the lawn at such a time much might
have been said and silence was very awkward she wanted to talk but
there seemed an embargo on every subject at last she recollected that
she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with
great perseverance yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tte tte was over on
mr and mrs gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go into the
house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted
on each side with the utmost politeness mr darcy handed the ladies
into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking
slowly towards the house
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle
there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her
aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now
say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud
i have seen nothing of it
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more
than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such
attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling
to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham
or rather he has not wickham's countenance for his features are
perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked
him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied
her uncle your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him
at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and
warn me off his grounds
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said
nothing
from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
any body as he has done by poor wickham he has not an ill-natured
look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when
he speaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure
the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming
character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a
liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant
comprehends every virtue
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as
guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his
relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different
construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor
wickham's so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire in
confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming
her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
any thing else fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing
but think and think with wonder of mr darcy's civility and above
all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister
chapter ii
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own
arrival at lambton these visitors came they had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle driving up the street elizabeth immediately recognising the
livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on
the business nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece while these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of
elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing she was quite amazed
at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked
up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction
took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself since her
being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy she found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though
little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance
womanly and graceful she was less handsome than her brother but there
was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was
also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley's quick step
was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room all
elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away but had she
still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her
again he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
done
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself they had long wished to see him the whole party before
them indeed excited a lively attention the suspicions which had just
arisen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love of the lady's sensations they remained a little in
doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough
elizabeth on her side had much to do she wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to
make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she
feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour bingley
was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a
like manner sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but though
this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour
to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane no look appeared
on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between
them that could justify the hopes of his sister on this point she was
soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of
jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that
might lead to the mention of her had he dared he observed to her at a
moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had
something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it
is above eight months we have not met since the 26th of november when
we were all dancing together at netherfield
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest
whether all her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the
question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner
which gave them meaning
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but
whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general
complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day when
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last
lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so
great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company
of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at
rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from
self-consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
rosings
their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose
to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner
at pemberley before they left the country miss darcy though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations
readily obeyed mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing
how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its
acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head presuming however
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of
society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for
her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to
make after all their hertfordshire friends elizabeth construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on
this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors
left them capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been
little eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiner's curiosity it was
not their wish to force her communication it was evident that she was
much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of
it was evident that he was very much in love with her they saw much to
interest but nothing to justify enquiry
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far
as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find they could
not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servant's report without any reference
to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognised it for mr darcy there was now an interest
however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be
hastily rejected neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight they
had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if
not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town where the family did not visit it was acknowledged
however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known
fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind
him which mr darcy afterwards discharged
as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than
the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and
she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she
certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him
that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his
favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light
which yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteem
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked it was gratitude gratitude not merely for having once
loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection he who she had been
persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this
accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without
any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where
their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion
of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister such a
change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but
gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means
unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined she respected she
esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his
welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still
possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that
such a striking civility as miss darcy's in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by
some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
morning they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though
when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon
chapter iii
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with
how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be
renewed
on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows
opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn
in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there
with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in
london georgiana's reception of them was very civil but attended with
all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs gardiner and
her niece however did her justice and pitied her
by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and
on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be
succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs annesley a
genteel agreeable-looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from
elizabeth the conversation was carried on miss darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley
and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without
calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether
she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine after
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss
bingley's voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family she answered with equal
indifference and brevity and the other said no more
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been
given to remind her of her post there was now employment for the whole
party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected
them round the table
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to
regret that he came
he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other
gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
georgiana that morning no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more
necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions
to mr darcy were by no means over miss darcy on her brother's
entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded
as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss
bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the
first opportunity of saying with sneering civility
pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton
they must be a great loss to your family
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name but elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress
but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone while
she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened
complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with
confusion and unable to lift up her eyes had miss bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose
elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
darcy's opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that
corps not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated
elopement to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was
possible except to elizabeth and from all bingley's connections her
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish
which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming
hereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend
elizabeth's collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and
as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to
wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able
to speak any more her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above-mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their
carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
elizabeth's person behaviour and dress but georgiana would not join
her her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his
judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as
to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister
how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy she cried i
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter
she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we
should not have known her again
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer
for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see
any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has no
brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants
character there is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are
tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which
have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing
extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not
like at all and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion which is intolerable
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not
the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always
wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the
success she expected he was resolutely silent however and from a
determination of making him speak she continued
i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect
your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield 'she
a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit' but afterwards she
seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that
was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance
he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during
their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested
them both the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention
they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every
thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner
thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by
her niece's beginning the subject
chapter iv
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had
been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but
on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere elizabeth was not surprised at it as
jane had written the direction remarkably ill
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her
uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by
themselves the one missent must be first attended to it had been
written five days ago the beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded
but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident
agitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effect
 since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of
 a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming
 you be assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to
 poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were
 all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was
 gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth
 with wickham imagine our surprise to kitty however it does not
 seem so wholly unexpected i am very very sorry so imprudent a
 match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that
 his character has been misunderstood thoughtless and indiscreet i
 can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it
 marks nothing bad at heart his choice is disinterested at least
 for he must know my father can give her nothing our poor mother
 is sadly grieved my father bears it better how thankful am i
 that we never let them know what has been said against him we must
 forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as
 is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at
 eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must
 have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason
 to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife
 informing her of their intention i must conclude for i cannot be
 long from my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make
 it out but i hardly know what i have written
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing
what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first
 by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried
 letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not
 confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer
 for being coherent dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would
 write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed
 imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia
 would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for
 there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland
 colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day
 before not many hours after the express though lydia's short
 letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to
 gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief
 that w never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which
 was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off
 from b intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to
 clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed
 into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
 from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen
 to continue the london road i know not what to think after making
 every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f came on into
 hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at
 the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such
 people had been seen to pass through with the kindest concern he
 came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
 most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and
 mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them our distress my
 dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst
 but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make it
 more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
 pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design
 against a young woman of lydia's connections which is not likely
 can i suppose her so lost to every thing impossible i grieve to
 find however that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their
 marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he
 feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill
 and keeps her room could she exert herself it would be better but
 this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life
 saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed
 their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot
 wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared
 something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock
 is over shall i own that i long for your return i am not so
 selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i
 take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not
 but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging
 you all to come here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle and
 aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have
 still something more to ask of the former my father is going to
 london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her what
 he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress
 will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
 way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again
 to-morrow evening in such an exigence my uncle's advice and
 assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately
 comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness
oh where where is my uncle cried elizabeth darting from her seat
as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a
moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was
opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to
speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia's
situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you
i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be
delayed i have not an instant to lose
good god what is the matter cried he with more feeling than
politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute
but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are
not well enough you cannot go yourself
elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them calling back
the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and
mistress home instantly
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and
looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her
or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration
let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very
ill
no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself there
is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could
not speak another word darcy in wretched suspense could only say
something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate
silence at length she spoke again i have just had a letter from
jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my
youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown
herself into the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together
from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no
money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for
ever
darcy was fixed in astonishment when i consider she added in a yet
more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew
what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what
i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not
have happened but it is all all too late now
i am grieved indeed cried darcy grieved shocked but is it
certain absolutely certain
oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced
almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to
scotland
and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her
my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but
nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is
such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have
not the smallest hope it is every way horrible
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence
when my eyes were opened to his real character oh had i known what
i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too
much wretched wretched mistake
darcy made no answer he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air
gloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it her power
was sinking every thing must sink under such a proof of family
weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace she could neither
wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress it
was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him as now when all love must be vain
but self though it would intrude could not engross her lydia the
humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up
every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief
elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of
several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke
compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that any
thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer
consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain
wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this
unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister's having the pleasure
of seeing you at pemberley to-day
oh yes be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy say that
urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible i know it cannot be long
he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for
her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only
one serious parting look went away
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of
contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but if
otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object and even before two words have been
exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go
with regret and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must
produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business never since reading jane's second letter had she entertained
a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her no one but jane she thought
could flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the least
of her feelings on this developement while the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that
wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for
money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible but now it was all too natural for such an attachment
as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not
suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the
intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that
lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body sometimes one
officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions
raised them in her opinion her affections had been continually
fluctuating but never without an object the mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl oh how acutely did she now
feel it
she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to
share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a
family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and
requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for lydia her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience
was severe mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing
by the servant's account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but
satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on
the postscript of the last with trembling energy though lydia had
never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be
deeply affected not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no
less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated
by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily
settled they were to be off as soon as possible but what is to be
done about pemberley cried mrs gardiner john told us mr darcy was
here when you sent for us was it so
yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement
that is all settled
that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to
prepare and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth oh that i knew how it was
but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their
sudden departure an hour however saw the whole completed and mr
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing
remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of
the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn
chapter v
i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they
drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel's family that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends
would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is
not adequate to the risk
do you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment
upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncle's
opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and
interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of
wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe
him capable of it
not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect
i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not
hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the
case
in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to scotland
oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the
barnet road
well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though
for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it
might strike them that they could be more economically though less
expeditiously married in london than in scotland
but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their
marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular
friend you see by jane's account was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he
cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she
beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your
other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no
brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father's
behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would
do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in
such a matter
but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage
it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with
tears in her eyes that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say
perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year
nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way
since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love
flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give
greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are
naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman
but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of
wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt
of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be
their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt
till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what
wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating
and do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive
i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring i told you the other day
of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at
longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other
circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to
relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from
what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud
reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her
but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you
and jane seem so well to understand
oh yes that that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw
so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was
ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time as that was the
case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it
apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it
was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a
consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts
when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i
suppose to believe them fond of each other
not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either
side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first
he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all
were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him
for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any
particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of
extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others
of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her
favourites
 
it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by
its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during
the whole of the journey from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness
they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on
the road reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day it was a
comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the
carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of
capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome
elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss
hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs
from her mother's apartment immediately met her
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the
eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives
not yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is come i hope
every thing will be well
is my father in town
yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word
and have you heard from him often
we have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i
particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write
again till he had something of importance to mention
and my mother how is she how are you all
my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly
shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all she does not yet leave her dressing-room mary and kitty thank
heaven are quite well
but you how are you cried elizabeth you look pale how much you
must have gone through
her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their
conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were
engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of
the whole party jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and
thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears
when they were all in the drawing-room the questions which elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon
found that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope of good
however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet
deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that
every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father
to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage
mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes
conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with
tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous
conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing
if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton
with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia
had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out
of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had
been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her but i was over-ruled as i always am poor dear
child and now here's mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight
wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is
to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold
in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what
we shall do
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told
her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist
mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia
do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be
prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain
it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we
may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married
and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as
lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him
come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done
oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i
could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out
wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them
marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but
tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them
after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from
fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened
out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me
such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at
heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear
lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen
me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother
how kind you are i know you will contrive it all
but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in
her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to
oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it
better that one only of the household and the one whom they could
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their
appearance before one came from her books and the other from her
toilette the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change
was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given
something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as
for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth
with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at
table
this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of
but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation
then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added
unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful
lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false
step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to
make any reply mary however continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to
satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss
bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued
the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which
i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel
forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place they must have seen them together for ever
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality
especially on lydia's side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so
grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he
was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had
any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension
first got abroad it hastened his journey
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of
their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself
yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am
inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before
and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a
doubt i suppose of their being really married
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a
little uneasy a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia's last
letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems
of their being in love with each other many weeks
but not before they went to brighton
no i believe not
and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself does he
know his real character
i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly
did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad
affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in
debt but i hope this may be false
oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him
this could not have happened
perhaps it would have been better replied her sister but to expose
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions
could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his
wife
he brought it with him for us to see
jane then took it from her pocket-book and gave it to elizabeth these
were the contents
 my dear harriet
 you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help
 laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning as soon as i am
 missed i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with
 who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the
 world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without
 him so think it no harm to be off you need not send them word at
 longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the
 surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia
 wickham what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for
 laughing pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my
 engagement and dancing with him to-night tell him i hope he will
 excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at
 the next ball we meet with great pleasure i shall send for my
 clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally
 to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
 packed up good bye give my love to colonel forster i hope you
 will drink to our good journey
 your affectionate friend
 lydia bennet
oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had
finished it what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but
at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a
scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it
i never saw any one so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten
minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in
such confusion
oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day
i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much
as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties
your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look
well oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone
mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every
fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them
kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn
on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till
thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady
lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to
condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if
they could be of use to us
she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she
meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too
little of one's neighbours assistance is impossible condolence
insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter
he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where
they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could
be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come
with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be
remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham if he could any how
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he
determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any
other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone
and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this
chapter vi
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next
morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain mr
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting
to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to
the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few
days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also
visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of
cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months
before had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with
the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesman's family
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world
and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness elizabeth though she did not credit above
half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still
less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now
come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before
entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some
news of them
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a
letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately
found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but
without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first
coming to london before they procured lodgings mr gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was
eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that mr
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and
promised to write again very soon there was also a postscript to this
effect
i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if
possible from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment
whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself if there
were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining
such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we
have nothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do every
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts
perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better
than any other person
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and
mother both of whom had been dead many years it was possible however
that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more
information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the
application was a something to look forward to
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning's impatience through letters
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance
but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for
their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence
she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his
letters always were looked over her and read it likewise it was as
follows
 my dear sir
 i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation
 in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
 suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
 from hertfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and
 myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable
 family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest
 kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no
 arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe
 a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that
 must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind the death
 of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this
 and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to
 suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness
 of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree
 of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of
 yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own
 disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of
 such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you
 are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined
 by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter
 to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in
 apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be
 injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady
 catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves
 with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to
 reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last
 november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in
 all your sorrow and disgrace let me advise you then my dear sir
 to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy
 child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the
 fruits of her own heinous offence
 i am dear sir c c
mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept
up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living
his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the
militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out
as likely to give any news of him and in the wretched state of his own
finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to
his fear of discovery by lydia's relations for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable
amount colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would
be necessary to clear his expences at brighton he owed a good deal in
the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable mr
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn
family jane heard them with horror a gamester she cried this is
wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it
mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day which was saturday rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours he had yielded to
his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit when mrs bennet was told of this she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before
what is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried sure he
will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickham
and make him marry her if he comes away
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she
and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet
came from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of their
journey and brought its master back to longbourn
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece
and the kind of half-expectation which mrs gardiner had formed of
their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from
pemberley
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be
fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware
that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of
lydia's infamy somewhat better it would have spared her she thought
one sleepless night out of two
when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure he said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him
away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it
it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say
nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing
and i ought to feel it
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth
you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to
fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have
been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression
it will pass away soon enough
do you suppose them to be in london
yes where else can they be so well concealed
and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty
she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there
will probably be of some duration
then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may which
considering the event shews some greatness of mind
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mother's
tea
this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an
elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in
my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble
as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away
i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i
should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia
you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as east bourne
for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and
you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter my house
again nor even to pass through the village balls will be absolutely
prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are
never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner
kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry
well well said he do not make yourself unhappy if you are a good
girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of
them
chapter vii
two days after mr bennet's return as jane and elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their
mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons
when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon
madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask
what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town
dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment don't you know
there is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been here
this half hour and master has had a letter
away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech they
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the
library their father was in neither and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the
butler who said
if you are looking for my master ma'am he is walking towards the
little copse
upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more
and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath
came up with him and eagerly cried out
oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle
yes i have had a letter from him by express
well and what news does it bring good or bad
what is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter from
his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand jane now came up
read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is
about
 gracechurch-street monday
 august 2
 my dear brother
 at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such
 as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction soon after
 you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what
 part of london they were the particulars i reserve till we meet
 it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them
 both 
then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married
 elizabeth read on i have seen them both they are not married
 nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are
 willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on
 your side i hope it will not be long before they are all that is
 required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her
 equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your
 children after the decease of yourself and my sister and
 moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your
 life one hundred pounds per annum these are conditions which
 considering every thing i had no hesitation in complying with as
 far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this by
 express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer you
 will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickham's
 circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
 be the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to
 say there will be some little money even when all his debts are
 discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune
 if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act
 in your name throughout the whole of this business i will
 immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper
 settlement there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
 to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on
 my diligence and care send back your answer as soon as you can
 and be careful to write explicitly we have judged it best that my
 niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will
 approve she comes to us to-day i shall write again as soon as any
 thing more is determined on your's c
 edw gardiner
is it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished can it be
possible that he will marry her
wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her
sister my dear father i congratulate you
and have you answered the letter said elizabeth
no but it must be done soon
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote
oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately
consider how important every moment is in such a case
let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble
yourself
i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done
and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house
and may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be
complied with
complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little
and they must marry yet he is such a man
yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there
are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am
ever to pay him
money my uncle cried jane what do you mean sir
i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life and fifty after i am
gone
that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me
before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh
it must be my uncle's doings generous good man i am afraid he has
distressed himself a small sum could not do all this
no said her father wickham's a fool if he takes her with a
farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so
ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship
ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be
repaid
mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued
silent till they reached the house their father then went to the
library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast-room
and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they
were by themselves how strange this is and for this we are to be
thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness
and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia
i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would
not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced he has
children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten
thousand pounds
if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been said
elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall
exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has
not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited their taking her home and affording her their personal
protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is
actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now
she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she
first sees my aunt
we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said
jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to marry
her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of
thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself
they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten
their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor
i nor any body can ever forget it is useless to talk of it
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the library
therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her he was writing and without raising his head
coolly replied
just as you please
may we take my uncle's letter to read to her
take whatever you like and get away
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up
stairs together mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one
communication would therefore do for all after a slight preparation
for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hardly
contain herself as soon as jane had read mr gardiner's hope of lydia's
being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence
added to its exuberance she was now in an irritation as violent from
delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation to know
that her daughter would be married was enough she was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct
my dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeed she will
be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my
good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage
every thing how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the
clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about
them directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how
much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell
kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear
lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr
gardiner's behaviour laid them all under
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great
measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself
to assist mr wickham with money
well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but
her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children
must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have
ever had any thing from him except a few presents well i am so happy
in a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs wickham how well
it sounds and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i am in
such a flutter that i am sure i can't write so i will dictate and you
write for me we will settle with your father about the money
afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and
cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had
not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted one day's delay she observed
would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual other schemes too came into her head
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the
good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on
lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down and order the carriage an
airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do any
thing for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have you
heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding
mrs hill began instantly to express her joy elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took
refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom
poor lydia's situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no
worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so and though in
looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity
could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they
had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained
chapter viii
mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that
instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for
the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived
him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that
respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her the satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be
her husband might then have rested in its proper place
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any
one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law and
he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his
assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could
when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly
useless for of course they were to have a son this son was to join
in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for five daughters
successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs
bennet for many years after lydia's birth had been certain that he
would this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too
late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and
the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents this was one point with
regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though
expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed
that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser by the
hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket
allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mother's hands lydia's expences had been very little within
that sum
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was
another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible when the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over he naturally returned to all his former indolence his letter was
soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was
quick in its execution he begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any
message to her
the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the
happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm
house but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her
misery was considered certain
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in
spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of
her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of
accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and
servants she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering
what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and
importance
haye-park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the
great house at stoke if the drawing-room were larger but ashworth is
too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for
purvis lodge the attics are dreadful
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs
bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
daughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage
the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it
soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion mrs bennet could hardly comprehend
it that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe
possible she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they
took place
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of
the moment been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means there were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended
but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much not however from any fear of
disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there
seemed a gulf impassable between them had lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that
mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other
objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink the
wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his
feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she
hardly knew of what she became jealous of his esteem when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it she wanted to hear of him when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced that
she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they
should meet
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now
have been gladly and gratefully received he was as generous she
doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal
there must be a triumph
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in
disposition and talents would most suit her his understanding and
temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes it
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease
and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved
and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must
have received benefit of greater importance
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was an union of a different tendency and
precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their
family
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence
she could not imagine but how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture
 
mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother to mr bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again the principal
purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia
 it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon
 as his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me
 in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both
 on his account and my niece's it is mr wickham's intention to go
 into the regulars and among his former friends there are still
 some who are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the
 promise of an ensigncy in general 's regiment now quartered in
 the north it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
 the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among different people
 where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be
 more prudent i have written to colonel forster to inform him of
 our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the
 various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with
 assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself and
 will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
 to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list
 according to his information he has given in all his debts i hope
 at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions and
 all will be completed in a week they will then join his regiment
 unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from
 mrs gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all
 before she leaves the south she is well and begs to be dutifully
 remembered to you and her mother your's c
 e gardiner
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal
from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do but mrs
bennet was not so well pleased with it lydia's being settled in the
north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with every body and had so many favourites
she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shocking
to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she
likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general 's
regiment
his daughter's request for such it might be considered of being
admitted into her family again before she set off for the north
received at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabeth who
agreed in wishing for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her
and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to
the north when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he
sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon
as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn elizabeth
was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme
and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes
chapter ix
their sister's wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet
them at and they were to return in it by dinner-time their
arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she
been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must
endure
they came the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
them smiles decked the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up to
the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed
anxious uneasy
lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and
she ran into the room her mother stepped forwards embraced her and
welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness
their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quite
so cordial his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely
opened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was
enough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was
shocked lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and
fearless she turned from sister to sister demanding their
congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly
round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and
observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been
there
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners
were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he
claimed their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour
there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near
elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world
only think of its being three months she cried since i went away
it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i
thought it would be very good fun if i was
her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked
expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the
people here abouts know i am married to-day i was afraid they might
not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was
determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to
him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like
any thing
elizabeth could bear it no longer she got up and ran out of the room
and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with
anxious parade walk up to her mother's right hand and hear her say to
her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go
lower because i am a married woman
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first her ease and good
spirits increased she longed to see mrs philips the lucases and all
their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs wickham by
each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her
ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two housemaids
well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast
room and what do you think of my husband is not he a charming man i
am sure my sisters must all envy me i only hope they may have half my
good luck they must all go to brighton that is the place to get
husbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all go
very true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i don't
at all like your going such a way off must it be so
oh lord yes there is nothing in that i shall like it of all
things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we
shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some
balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all
i should like it beyond any thing said her mother
and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over
i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them mr wickham
had received his commission before he left london and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight
no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and
having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to
all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think than such as did not
wickham's affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to
find it not equal to lydia's for him she had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring
for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and
if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion
lydia was exceedingly fond of him he was her dear wickham on every
occasion no one was to be put in competition with him he did every
thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of september than any body else in the country
one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters she said to elizabeth
lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were
not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you
curious to hear how it was managed
no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said
on the subject
la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were
married you know at st clement's because wickham's lodgings were in
that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others
were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in
such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put
it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my
aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten
for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat
well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never
be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if you'll believe
me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a
fortnight not one party or scheme or any thing to be sure london was
rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just
as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get
together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not
know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond
the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back
again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i
recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the
wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well
mr darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazement
oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me
i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised
them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret
if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the
subject you may depend upon my seeking no further
oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will
ask you no questions
thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you
all and then wickham would be angry
on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power by running away
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it
was impossible not to try for information mr darcy had been at her
sister's wedding it was exactly a scene and exactly among people
where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her
brain but she was satisfied with none those that best pleased her as
placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable she
could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper
wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what
lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively
speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such
a time pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is
for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to
think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance
not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the
letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out
jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of
it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante
chapter x
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it than
hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be
interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be
happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial
 gracechurch-street sept 6
 my dear niece
 i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole
 morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will
 not comprise what i have to tell you i must confess myself
 surprised by your application i did not expect it from you
 don't think me angry however for i only mean to let you know
 that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your
 side if you do not choose to understand me forgive my
 impertinence your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing
 but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed
 him to act as he has done but if you are really innocent and
 ignorant i must be more explicit on the very day of my coming
 home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor mr
 darcy called and was shut up with him several hours it was all
 over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
 as your's seems to have been he came to tell mr gardiner that
 he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that
 he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia
 once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day
 after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting
 for them the motive professed was his conviction of its being
 owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well
 known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character
 to love or confide in him he generously imputed the whole to his
 mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
 him to lay his private actions open to the world his character
 was to speak for itself he called it therefore his duty to step
 forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on
 by himself if he had another motive i am sure it would never
 disgrace him he had been some days in town before he was able to
 discover them but he had something to direct his search which was
 more than we had and the consciousness of this was another
 reason for his resolving to follow us there is a lady it seems a
 mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was
 dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though
 he did not say what she then took a large house in edward-street
 and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings this mrs
 younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he
 went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but
 it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
 wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery
 and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be
 found wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in
 london and had she been able to receive them into her house they
 would have taken up their abode with her at length however our
 kind friend procured the wished-for direction they were in 
 street he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia
 his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade
 her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her
 friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her
 offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found lydia
 absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none
 of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of
 leaving wickham she was sure they should be married some time or
 other and it did not much signify when since such were her
 feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a
 marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he
 easily learnt had never been his design he confessed himself
 obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour
 which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the
 ill-consequences of lydia's flight on her own folly alone he
 meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future
 situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go
 somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have
 nothing to live on mr darcy asked him why he had not married your
 sister at once though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich
 he would have been able to do something for him and his situation
 must have been benefited by marriage but he found in reply to
 this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more
 effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country
 under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof
 against the temptation of immediate relief they met several times
 for there was much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more
 than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable
 every thing being settled between them mr darcy's next step was
 to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in
 gracechurch-street the evening before i came home but mr gardiner
 could not be seen and mr darcy found on further enquiry that
 your father was still with him but would quit town the next
 morning he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could
 so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed
 seeing him till after the departure of the former he did not
 leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a
 gentleman had called on business on saturday he came again your
 father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they
 had a great deal of talk together they met again on sunday and
 then i saw him too it was not all settled before monday as soon
 as it was the express was sent off to longbourn but our visitor
 was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real
 defect of his character after all he has been accused of many
 faults at different times but this is the true one nothing was
 to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do
 not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your
 uncle would most readily have settled the whole they battled it
 together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman
 or lady concerned in it deserved but at last your uncle was forced
 to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece
 was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it
 which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your
 letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an
 explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give
 the praise where it was due but lizzy this must go no farther
 than yourself or jane at most you know pretty well i suppose
 what has been done for the young people his debts are to be paid
 amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds
 another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his
 commission purchased the reason why all this was to be done by him
 alone was such as i have given above it was owing to him to his
 reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham's character
 had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been
 received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth in
 this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody's
 reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this
 fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that
 your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit
 for another interest in the affair when all this was resolved
 on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at
 pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more
 when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to
 receive the last finish i believe i have now told you every thing
 it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i
 hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure lydia came to
 us and wickham had constant admission to the house he was
 exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i
 would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour
 while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane's letter
 last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
 piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no
 fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner
 representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and
 all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she heard me
 it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was
 sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth
 and jane and for their sakes had patience with her mr darcy was
 punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the
 wedding he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again
 on wednesday or thursday will you be very angry with me my dear
 lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold
 enough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us has
 in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire
 his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but
 a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his
 wife may teach him i thought him very sly he hardly ever
 mentioned your name but slyness seems the fashion pray forgive
 me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so
 far as to exclude me from p i shall never be quite happy till i
 have been all round the park a low phaeton with a nice little
 pair of ponies would be the very thing but i must write no more
 the children have been wanting me this half hour your's very
 sincerely
 m gardiner
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the
pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with
persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to
avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her
heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope
shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her
vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for
her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham
brother-in-law of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the
connection he had to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how
much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising
it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement
she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned it was painful exceedingly painful to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing
to him oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation
she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed
towards him for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get
the better of himself she read over her aunt's commendation of him
again and again it was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even
sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one's
approach and before she could strike into another path she was
overtaken by wickham
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said he
as he joined her
you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome
i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends
and now we are better
true are the others coming out
i do not know mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to
meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that
you have actually seen pemberley
she replied in the affirmative
i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much
for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the
old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of
me but of course she did not mention my name to you
yes she did
and what did she say
that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned
out well at such a distance as that you know things are strangely
misrepresented
certainly he replied biting his lips elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him but he soon afterwards said
i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other
several times i wonder what he can be doing there
perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said
elizabeth it must be something particular to take him there at this
time of year
undoubtedly did you see him while you were at lambton i thought i
understood from the gardiners that you had
yes he introduced us to his sister
and do you like her
very much
i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad
you liked her i hope she will turn out well
i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age
did you go by the village of kympton
i do not recollect that we did
i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had a
most delightful place excellent parsonage house it would have suited
me in every respect
how should you have liked making sermons
exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty and
the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to
repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the
quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas
of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the
circumstance when you were in kent
i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was
left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron
you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the
first you may remember
i did hear too that there was a time when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business
had been compromised accordingly
you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember
what i told you on that point when first we talked of it
they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast
to get rid of him and unwilling for her sister's sake to provoke him
she only said in reply with a good-humoured smile
come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know do not let us
quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one
mind
she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though
he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house
chapter xi
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth
by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came and mrs bennet was
forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth
oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again
oh lord i don't know not these two or three years perhaps
write to me very often my dear
as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for
writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to
do
mr wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's he
smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things
he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of
the house as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us
all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law
the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days
i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends one seems so forlorn without them
this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said
elizabeth it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single
it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off if
that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was
shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by
an article of news which then began to be in circulation the
housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot
there for several weeks mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets she
looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns
well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister for mrs
philips first brought her the news well so much the better not that
i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure
i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to
come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what may happen
but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is coming
you may depend on it replied the other for mrs nicholls was in
meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he
comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was
going to the butcher's she told me on purpose to order in some meat on
wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be
killed
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour it was many months since she had mentioned his name to
elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said
i saw you look at me to-day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present
report and i know i appeared distressed but don't imagine it was from
any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt
that i should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not
affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he
comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid
of myself but i dread other people's remarks
elizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him in
derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial
to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there with his friend's permission or being bold enough to come
without it
yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come
to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this
speculation i will leave him to himself
in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her
feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbed
more unequal than she had often seen them
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents
about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again
as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet you
will wait on him of course
no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i
went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in
nothing and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to
netherfield
'tis an etiquette i despise said he if he wants our society let
him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend my hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again
well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him but however that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here i am determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon
that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at
table for him
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they
did as the day of his arrival drew near
i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister it
would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of my mother means well
but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she
says happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over
i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but
it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because
you have always so much
mr bingley arrived mrs bennet through the assistance of servants
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could she counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent
hopeless of seeing him before but on the third morning after his
arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing-room window
enter the paddock and ride towards the house
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy jane resolutely
kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went
to the window she looked she saw mr darcy with him and sat down
again by her sister
there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be
some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not
know
la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before mr what's his name that tall proud man
good gracious mr darcy and so it does i vow well any friend of
mr bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must
say that i hate the very sight of him
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little
of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter both sisters were uncomfortable
enough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their
mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be
civil to him only as mr bingley's friend without being heard by either
of them but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs
gardiner's letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and
whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive
information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an
interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as
what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his coming at his
coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in derbyshire
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a
minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken but she would not be secure
let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early
enough for expectation
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to
lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister as the servant was approaching the door jane looked a little
paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on the
gentlemen's appearing her colour increased yet she received them with
tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down
again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command she
had ventured only one glance at darcy he looked serious as usual and
she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as
she had seen him at pemberley but perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt it was a painful but
not an improbable conjecture
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied
darcy after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a question
which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing
he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence
but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her
friends when he could not to herself but now several minutes elapsed
without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable
to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she
as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no
object but the ground more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please
than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed
and angry with herself for being so
could i expect it to be otherwise said she yet why did he come
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to
him she had hardly courage to speak
she enquired after his sister but could do no more
it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs bennet
he readily agreed to it
i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope
it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood
since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my
own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have
seen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i know
though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said 'lately
george wickham esq to miss lydia bennet' without there being a
syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too and i wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it did you see it
bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes how mr darcy looked therefore she could
not tell
it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married
continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down to
newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to
stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you
have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the
regulars thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so
many as he deserves
elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in such misery
of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from her
however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually
done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present a few weeks he believed
when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother
i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr
bennet's manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and
will save all the best of the covies for you
elizabeth's misery increased at such unnecessary such officious
attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion at that instant she felt
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be
in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either
one or the other again
yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but little
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he
found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as
unaffected though not quite so chatty jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busily engaged
that she did not always know when she was silent
when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was mindful of her
intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at
longbourn in a few days time
you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when
you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with
us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure
you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business they then went away
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did
not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a
man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and
pride of one who had ten thousand a-year
chapter xii
as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits
or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more mr darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her
why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she
did he come at all
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when
he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if
he no longer cares for me why silent teazing teazing man i will
think no more about him
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her
better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth
now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly
easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly
seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance
yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh jane
take care
my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now
i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever
 
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in
the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good
humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hour's visit had
revived
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two
who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen were in very good time when they repaired to the
dining-room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by
her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to
invite him to sit by herself on entering the room he seemed to
hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was
decided he placed himself by her
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend he
bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of half-laughing
alarm
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an
admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded
elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane's happiness and his
own would be speedily secured though she dared not depend upon the
consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour it
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in
no cheerful humour mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them he was on one side of her mother she knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to
advantage she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did her mother's ungraciousness
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind
and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance anxious and
uneasy the period which passed in the drawing-room before the
gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her
uncivil she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend
if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for
ever
the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table
where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee
in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair and on the gentlemen's approaching one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper
the men shan't come and part us i am determined we want none of them
do we
darcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with
her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself
for being so silly
a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings
she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself and she seized the opportunity of saying
is your sister at pemberley still
yes she will remain there till christmas
and quite alone have all her friends left her
mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough
these three weeks
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse
with her he might have better success he stood by her however for
some minutes in silence and at last on the young lady's whispering
to elizabeth again he walked away
when the tea-things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies
all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when
all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party she now lost every expectation of pleasure
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had
nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others and she had no opportunity of detaining them
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what
say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well
i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the
venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat
a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucas's last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges
were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french
cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater
beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and
what do you think she said besides 'ah mrs bennet we shall have her
at netherfield at last' she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good
a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls
and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously
mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of
bingley's behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at
last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy
humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth the
party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we
may often meet again
elizabeth smiled
lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i
assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any
design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing than any other man
you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and
are provoking me to it every moment
how hard it is in some cases to be believed
and how impossible in others
but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i
acknowledge
that is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love to
instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive
me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your
confidante
chapter xiii
a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone his
friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in
ten days time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably
good spirits mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many
expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky
he should be particularly happy at any time c c and if she would
give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them
can you come to-morrow
yes he had no engagement at all for to-morrow and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
dressed in ran mrs bennet to her daughter's room in her dressing
gown and with her hair half finished crying out
my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is come mr bingley is
come he is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to miss
bennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss
lizzy's hair
we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is
forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago
oh hang kitty what has she to do with it come be quick be quick
where is your sash my dear
but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his
custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument two obstacles of the
five being thus removed mrs bennet sat looking and winking at
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any
impression on them elizabeth would not observe her and when at last
kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma what do
you keep winking at me for what am i to do
nothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat still five
minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she
suddenly got up and saying to kitty
come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at
such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it
in a few minutes mrs bennet half opened the door and called out
lizzy my dear i want to speak with you
elizabeth was forced to go
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained
quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned
into the drawing-room
mrs bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was every
thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter his
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went
away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs
bennet's means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband
after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word passed
between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy
returned within the stated time seriously however she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the
morning together as had been agreed on the latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected there was nothing of presumption
or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him
into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to dinner
and in the evening mrs bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter
to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes
but on returning to the drawing-room when her letter was finished she
saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived her
sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in
earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of
both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would
have told it all their situation was awkward enough but her's she
thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and
elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as
well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few
words to her sister ran out of the room
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give
pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest
emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world
'tis too much she added by far too much i do not deserve it oh
why is not every body as happy
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a
delight which words could but poorly express every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be
said for the present
i must go instantly to my mother she cried i would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy to
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family how shall i bear so much happiness
she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the
card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation
and this said she is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance the
happiest wisest most reasonable end
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose
where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door
with my mother up stairs she will be down in a moment i dare say
he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship they shook hands with
great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane's perfections
and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for
basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of
jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of
miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as
made her look handsomer than ever kitty simpered and smiled and hoped
her turn was coming soon mrs bennet could not give her consent or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings
though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when
mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed
how really happy he was
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their
visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he
turned to his daughter and said
jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman
jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his
goodness
you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your
doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are
each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so
easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will
always exceed your income
i hope not so imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in me
exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you
talking of why he has four or five thousand a-year and very likely
more then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so
happy i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it
would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when
he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was
that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen
wickham lydia were all forgotten jane was beyond competition her
favourite child at that moment she cared for no other her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn
coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after
supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough
detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought
himself obliged to accept
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for
while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those
hours of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane
he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of
her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of
relief
he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not
believed it possible
i suspected as much replied elizabeth but how did he account for
it
it must have been his sister's doing they were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see
as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will
learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we
can never be what we once were to each other
that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever
heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again
the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november
he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again
he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his
modesty
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and
the little value he put on his own good qualities
elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried
jane oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed
above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but
such another man for you
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as
you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your
happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very
good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
secret mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips and
she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her
neighbours in meryton
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune
chapter xiv
one morning about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been
formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the
sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours the horses
were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it were familiar to them as it was certain however that
somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the
shrubbery they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown
open and their visitor entered it was lady catherine de bourgh
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs
bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even
inferior to what elizabeth felt
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no
other reply to elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the
head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance though no request of
introduction had been made
mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance received her with the utmost politeness after sitting
for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth
i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was
and that i suppose is one of your sisters
yes madam said mrs bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine
she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man
who i believe will soon become a part of the family
you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short
silence
it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i
assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in
summer the windows are full west
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then
added
may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and
mrs collins well
yes very well i saw them the night before last
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling but no
letter appeared and she was completely puzzled
mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely
declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth
miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you
will favour me with your company
go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the
different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol
attended her noble guest down stairs as they passed through the hall
lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent
looking rooms walked on
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable
how could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked in
her face
as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following
manner 
you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my
journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i
come
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment
indeed you are mistaken madam i have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here
miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to
know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere you may
choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such
moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that
you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon
afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i
know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on
setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to
you
if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring
with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far what could your ladyship propose by it
at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted
your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth
coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report
is in existence
if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad
i never heard that it was
and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship you
may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer
this is not to be borne miss bennet i insist on being satisfied has
he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible
it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his
reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you
may have drawn him in
if i have i shall be the last person to confess it
miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such
language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as
this ever induce me to be explicit
let me be rightly understood this match to which you have the
presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is
engaged to my daughter now what have you to say
only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied
the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy
they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of
his mother as well as of her's while in their cradles we planned
the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to
the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin
yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be
kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage its completion depended on others if mr darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make
another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him
because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes miss
bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all you will
be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth but the wife of mr
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause
to repine
obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that
score
let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came here
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be
dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any person's whims
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment
that will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable
but it will have no effect on me
i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal
side from the same noble line and on the father's from respectable
honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both
sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or
fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you
were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere
in which you have been brought up
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentleman's daughter so far we are
equal
true you are a gentleman's daughter but who was your mother who
are your uncles and aunts do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition
whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does
not object to them they can be nothing to you
tell me once for all are you engaged to him
though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady
catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a
moment's deliberation
i am not
lady catherine seemed pleased
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement
i will make no promise of the kind
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more
reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i
will ever recede i shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance i require
and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry
your daughter but would my giving you the wished-for promise make
their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to
me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it
on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged you have widely mistaken my
character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs
i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the
subject
not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the
objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement i know it all that the young man's marrying her was a
patched-up business at the expence of your father and uncles and is
such a girl to be my nephew's sister is her husband is the son of
his late father's steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what
are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted
you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered
you have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to
the house
and she rose as she spoke lady catherine rose also and they turned
back her ladyship was highly incensed
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew
unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody
lady catherine i have nothing farther to say you know my sentiments
you are then resolved to have him
i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner
which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without
reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me
it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the
claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world
neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any
possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the
resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former
were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment's
concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn
and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i
shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your
ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you
reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of
the carriage when turning hastily round she added
i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your
mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased
elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself she
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room to ask why lady
catherine would not come in again and rest herself
she did not choose it said her daughter she would go
she is a very fine-looking woman and her calling here was prodigiously
civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well
she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through
meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you lizzy
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible
chapter xv
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many
hours learn to think of it less than incessantly lady catherine it
appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr
darcy it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of
their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley
and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply
the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together and her neighbours at
lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the
collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only
set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked
forward to as possible at some future time
in revolving lady catherine's expressions however she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared
not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it
was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would
address him on his weakest side with his notions of dignity he would
probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often
seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him in that case he would return no more lady
catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to
bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to
his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to
understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of
his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might
have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him
at all
 
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had
been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased mrs bennet's curiosity and
elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her
father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down he
then said
i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its
contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony let me congratulate you on a very important conquest
the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself when her father continued
you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the
name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins
from mr collins and what can he have to say
something very much to the purpose of course he begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of
which it seems he has been told by some of the good-natured gossiping
lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says
on that point what relates to yourself is as follows having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on
this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another
of which we have been advertised by the same authority your daughter
elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after
her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate
may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land
can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this this young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive
patronage yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin
elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals which of course you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of
have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out
my motive for cautioning you is as follows we have reason to imagine
that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with
a friendly eye
mr darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have
surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within
the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in
his life it is admirable
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry but could only force
one most reluctant smile never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her
are you not diverted
oh yes pray read on
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she
felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned mr
collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married it was an
encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should
very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing that is his notion of christian
forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's
situation and his expectation of a young olive-branch but lizzy you
look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be missish i
hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we
live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our
turn
oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted but it is so
strange
yes that is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your
pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate
writing i would not give up mr collins's correspondence for any
consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving
him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law and pray lizzy what said lady catherine
about this report did she call to refuse her consent
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his
repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not it was necessary to laugh when she
would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortified her by
what he said of mr darcy's indifference and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of
his seeing too little she might have fancied too much
chapter xvi
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as
elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy
with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's
visit the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed
their all walking out it was agreed to mrs bennet was not in the
habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five
set off together bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to
outstrip them they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy
were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same
they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon
maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern
when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was
high she immediately said
mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your's i
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest
of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express
i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise
and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a
mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs
gardiner was so little to be trusted
you must not blame my aunt lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could
not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again
in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the
sake of discovering them
if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your
family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought
only of you
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause
her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me if your
feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my
affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not
very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances the
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never
felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do had elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight diffused over his face became him
but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of
feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his
affection every moment more valuable
they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to
be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects she
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through
london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the
substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter which in her ladyship's apprehension
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew which she had refused to give but unluckily for her
ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise
it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that
had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have
acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of
my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so
abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations
what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your
accusations were ill-founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour
to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was
unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening said elizabeth the conduct of neither if strictly examined
will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved
in civility
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i
then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of
it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your
reproof so well applied i shall never forget 'had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner' those were your words you know not you
can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some
time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice
i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way
i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never
forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me
oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at
all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it
darcy mentioned his letter did it said he did it soon make you
think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its
contents
she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed
i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was
necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part
especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the
power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me
the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily
changed as that implies
when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly
calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit
the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the
adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings
of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so
widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some
of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of
ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will
intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a
selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a
child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my
temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride
and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child
i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father
particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond
my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to
wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might
still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not
owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most
advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a
doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased
had you then persuaded yourself that i should
indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be
wishing expecting my addresses
my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you
i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong
how you must have hated me after that evening
hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at
pemberley you blamed me for coming
no indeed i felt nothing but surprise
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i
confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due
my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility
in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped
to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes
introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an
hour after i had seen you
he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend
she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to
each to be dwelt on farther
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know
any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that
it was time to be at home
what could become of mr bingley and jane was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs darcy was delighted with
their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of
it
i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth
not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen
that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much and
though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much
the case
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession
to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs
absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the
slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself
mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent
to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him
that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring
from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection
and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to
him
it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but
his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess
one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was
angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments he has heartily forgiven me
now
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful
friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked
herself she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it
was rather too early to begin in anticipating the happiness of bingley
which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the
conversation till they reached the house in the hall they parted
chapter xvii
my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and
from all the others when they sat down to table she had only to say in
reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own
knowledge she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing
else awakened a suspicion of the truth
the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary the
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth
and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy
than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment
there were other evils before her she anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one
liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away
at night she opened her heart to jane though suspicion was very far
from miss bennet's general habits she was absolutely incredulous here
you are joking lizzy this cannot be engaged to mr darcy no no
you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible
this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and
i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am
in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are
engaged
jane looked at her doubtingly oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much
you dislike him
you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i
did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these
a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever
remember it myself
miss bennet still looked all amazement elizabeth again and more
seriously assured her of its truth
good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried
jane my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you
certain forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him
there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased
jane shall you like to have such a brother
very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more
delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you
really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do any thing rather than
marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do
oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i
tell you all
what do you mean
why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am
afraid you will be angry
my dearest sister now be be serious i want to talk very seriously
let me know every thing that i am to know without delay will you tell
me how long you have loved him
it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at pemberley
another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the
desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing
farther to wish
now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself i
always had a value for him were it for nothing but his love of you i
must always have esteemed him but now as bingley's friend and your
husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but
lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know
of it to another not to you
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy she had been unwilling to
mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in lydia's marriage all was acknowledged
and half the night spent in conversation
 
good gracious cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next
morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with
our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or
other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him
lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley's
way
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and
shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information
and he soon afterwards said aloud mr bennet have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day
i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs bennet to walk
to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has
never seen the view
it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am
sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently
consented as she went up stairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her
saying
i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is
all for jane's sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to
him except just now and then so do not put yourself to
inconvenience
during their walk it was resolved that mr bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's she could not determine how her mother
would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man but whether she
were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation
 
in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw
mr darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme she did not fear her father's opposition but he was going to
be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she
his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched
reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when
looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile in a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he
wants you in the library she was gone directly
her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious
lizzy said he what are you doing are you out of your senses to be
accepting this man have not you always hated him
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give
but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of
her attachment to mr darcy
or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be
sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane
but will they make you happy
have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my
indifference
none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but
this would be nothing if you really liked him
i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him
indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not
know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms
lizzy said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind
of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he
condescended to ask i now give it to you if you are resolved on
having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your
disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked
up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage you could scarcely escape
discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing
you unable to respect your partner in life you know not what you are
about
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply
and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the
object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many
months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she
did conquer her father's incredulity and reconcile him to the match
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to
say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with
you my lizzy to any one less worthy
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy
had voluntarily done for lydia he heard her with astonishment
this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing
made up the match gave the money paid the fellow's debts and got him
his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble
and economy had it been your uncle's doing i must and would have
paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way i shall offer to pay him to-morrow he will rant and storm about
his love for you and there will be an end of the matter
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading
mr collins's letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her
at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come
for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure every thing was too recent for
gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any
thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night she followed her
and made the important communication its effect was most
extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and
unable to utter a syllable nor was it under many many minutes that
she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to
credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the
shape of a lover to any of them she began at length to recover to
fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless
herself
good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr darcy who would
have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich
and how great you will be what pin-money what jewels what carriages
you will have jane's is nothing to it nothing at all i am so
pleased so happy such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my
dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before i
hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town every thing
that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh
lord what will become of me i shall go distracted
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and
elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself
soon went away but before she had been three minutes in her own room
her mother followed her
my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else ten
thousand a year and very likely more 'tis as good as a lord and a
special licence you must and shall be married by a special licence but
my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of
that i may have it to-morrow
this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations'
consent there was still something to be wished for but the morrow
passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak
to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark
her deference for his opinion
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem
i admire all my three sons-in-law highly said he wickham perhaps
is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well
as jane's
chapter xviii
elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her how could
you begin said she i can comprehend your going on charmingly when
you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first
place
i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which
laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i
knew that i had begun
my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour
to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere
did you admire me for my impertinence
for the liveliness of your mind i did
you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious
attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and
interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and
in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it
and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly
reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks
of that when they fall in love
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was
ill at netherfield
dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it
by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first
called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did
you look as if you did not care about me
because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement
but i was embarrassed
and so was i
you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner
a man who had felt less might
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you
would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when
you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too
much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the
subject this will never do
you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady
catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's my aunt's intelligence had given me
hope and i was determined at once to know every thing
lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy
for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to
netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed
or had you intended any more serious consequence
my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i
might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to
myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley
and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to
befall her
i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to
be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done
directly
and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but
i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy
had been over-rated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner's
long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as
follows
 i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have
 done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but
 to say the truth i was too cross to write you supposed more than
 really existed but now suppose as much as you chuse give a
 loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible
 flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me
 actually married you cannot greatly err you must write again very
 soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last i
 thank you again and again for not going to the lakes how could i
 be so silly as to wish it your idea of the ponies is delightful
 we will go round the park every day i am the happiest creature in
 the world perhaps other people have said so before but not one
 with such justice i am happier even than jane she only smiles i
 laugh mr darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can
 spare from me you are all to come to pemberley at christmas
 your's c
mr darcy's letter to lady catherine was in a different style and
still different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr collins in
reply to his last
 dear sir
 i must trouble you once more for congratulations elizabeth will
 soon be the wife of mr darcy console lady catherine as well as
 you can but if i were you i would stand by the nephew he has
 more to give
 your's sincerely c
miss bingley's congratulations to her brother on his approaching
marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere she wrote even
to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her
former professions of regard jane was not deceived but she was
affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was
as sincere as her brother's in sending it four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister
before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations
to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the
collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge the reason of this sudden
removal was soon evident lady catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter that
charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over at such a moment the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she
saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband he bore it however with admirable calmness he could even
listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at st james's with very decent composure if he did
shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight
mrs philips's vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance and though mrs philips as well as her sister stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good
humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar
nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all
likely to make her more elegant elizabeth did all she could to shield
him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it
added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
pemberley
chapter xix
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted pride she
afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed
i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable
well-informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do he delighted in
going to pemberley especially when he was least expected
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth so near
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
his easy temper or her affectionate heart the darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source
of happiness were within thirty miles of each other
kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters in society so superior to what she had generally
known her improvement was great she was not of so ungovernable a
temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia's example she
became by proper attention and management less irritable less
ignorant and less insipid from the farther disadvantage of lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of
balls and young men her father would never consent to her going
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone mary was obliged to mix more with the world but
she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance
as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every
thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received
from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least
if not by himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this
effect
 my dear lizzy
 i wish you joy if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear
 wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you
 so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will
 think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court very
 much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
 upon without some help any place would do of about three or four
 hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it
 if you had rather not
 yours c
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences she
frequently sent them it had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to
their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills their manner of living even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the
extreme they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation and always spending more than they ought his affection for
her soon sunk into indifference her's lasted a little longer and in
spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for
elizabeth's sake he assisted him farther in his profession lydia was
occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long that even bingley's good humour was overcome and he
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she
dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as
attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility
to elizabeth
pemberley was now georgiana's home and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each
other even as well as they intended georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of
talking to her brother he who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open
pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him
language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time
all intercourse was at an end but at length by elizabeth's persuasion
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation
and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her
resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on
them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms darcy
as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing
her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them

array of equipment including outdated equipment many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance to
send donations or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate
while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate
international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the united states us laws alone swamp our small staff
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
