==============================================
HW4a - old
Write a program that reads the following filename (it must have exactly this name) and outputs the desired output;

The file is "HW4a.txt"

 

The input will be a list of the following instructions : ADD_FRONT, ADD_BACK, REMOVE_FRONT, REMOVE_BACK, OUTPUT.

Start with an empty GrowArray (not the kind we did in class, the one for homework is supposed to have a variable used and double each time it grows).  Here are the details of each instruction.

ADD_FRONT start:step:end  // means add start, start+step, start+2*step, ... end at the front of the array

ADD_BACKstart:step:end  // means add start, start+step, start+2*step, ... end at the end of the array

REMOVE_FRONT N  // means remove the first N numbers from the list

REMOVE_BACK M // means remove the last M numbers from the list

OUTPUT  // output the numbers in the array

 

For example

ADD_FRONT 1:2:10

ADD_BACK  5:5:25

OUTPUT

REMOVE_FRONT 2

REMOVE_BACK 2

OUTPUT

would output:

9,7,5,3,1,5,10,15,20,25

5,3,1,5,10,15
